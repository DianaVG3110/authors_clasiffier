I ain't got too much time to spare
But I'll make time for you to show how much I care
Wish that I would let you break my walls
But I'm still spinning out of control from the fall
Boy, you give good love, I won't lie
It's what keeps me coming back even though I'm terrified

I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Hmm, yeah, hmm, yeah
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Hmm, yeah, hmm, yeah

Oh my God, I can't believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping
Out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of heaven and hell
Is a battle that I cannot fight

I'm a fool, but they all think I'm blind
I'd rather be a fool than leave myself behind
I don't have to explain myself to you
I am a grown woman and I do what I want to do

I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Hmm, yeah, hmm, yeah
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Hmm, yeah, hmm, yeah

Oh my God, I can't believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping
Out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of heaven and hell
Is a battle that I cannot fight

Lord don't let me
I said, Lord don't let me
I said, Lord don't let me, let me down (oh, Lord)

Lord don't let me
I said, Lord don't let me
I said, Lord don't let me, let me down (don't let me let myself down)

Lord don't let me
I said, Lord don't let me
I said, Lord don't let me, let me down (oh my God)

Lord don't let me
I said, Lord don't let me
I said, Lord don't let me, let me down

Oh my God, I can't believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping
Out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of heaven and hell
Is a battle that I cannot fight

I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Hmm, yeah, hmm, yeah
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Hmm, yeah, hmm, yeah


There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare

See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could've had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one of you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling

We could've had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could've had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could've had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

But you played it
You played it
You played it
You played it to the beat


There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washing my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in

Go easy on me, baby!
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do

So, go easy on me

There ain't no room for our things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I have tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But, now, I give up

Go easy on me, baby!
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do

So, go easy on me

I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn't even show

Go easy on me, baby!
I was still a child
I didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do

So, go easy on me


I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing gets better

'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

Oh, oh, no
Let it burn
Oh, oh, oh
Let it burn
Let it burn


I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things, I didn't give to you

Old friend
Why are you so shy?
It ain't like you to hold back
Or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead, yeah, yeah


This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again

For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At Skyfall
At Skyfall

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

Let the sky fall (let she skyfall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together

Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At Skyfall

(Let the sky fall)
(When it crumbles)
(We will stand tall)

(Let the sky fall)
(When it crumbles)
(We will stand tall)

Where you go, I go
What you see, I see
I know I'd never be me without the security
Of your loving arms keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand and we'll stand

Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together

Let the sky fall (let the Skyfall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At Skyfall

Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At Skyfall
Ooh


When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
Though winds of change are throwing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love


Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Anymore

Hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore


Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
Please, stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind

I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Everything changed me

You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all, the more that we will fight
Please, don't fall apart
I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave
Stop asking me to stay

I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Everything changed me

We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to me
That you are in my life
But I want to live
And not just survive

That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Everything changed me
I, I, I, I, I don't think you can save me


I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what's coming next
Or scared of having nothing left?

Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that mattered
Tell me, who do I run to?

Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?


This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands all over my body and told me
You told me you were ready
For the big one, for the big jump
I'd be your last love everlasting, you and me
That was what you told me

I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

I was too strong, you were trembling
You couldn't handle the hot heat rising (rising)
Baby, I'm so rising
I was running, you were walking
You couldn't keep up, you were falling down (down)
There's only one way down

I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

If you're ready, if you're ready
If you're ready, I am ready
If you're ready, if you're ready
We both know we ain't kids no more
No, we ain't kids no more

I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

If you're ready, if you're ready (send my love to your new lover)
If you're ready, are you ready? (treat her better)
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

If you're ready, if you're ready (send my love to your new lover)
If you're ready, are you ready? (treat her better)
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more


How can one become so bounded by choices that somebody else makes?
How come we've both become a version of a person we don't even like?
We're in love with the world, but the world just wants to bring us down
By putting ideas in our heads that corrupt our hearts somehow

When I was a child every single thing could blow my mind
Soaking it all up for fun, but now I only soak up wine
They say to play hard, you work hard, find balance in the sacrifice
Yet I don't know anybody who's truly satisfied

You better believe I'm trying (trying, trying)
To keep climbing (climbing, climbing)
But the higher we climb, feels like we're both none the wiser (ah-ah-ah)

So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop trying to be somebody else
So we can love each other for free
Everybody wants something, you just want me

Why am I obsessing about the things I can't control?
Why am I seeking approval from people I don't even know?
In these crazy times, I hope to find something I can cling on to
'Cause I need some substance in my life, something real, something that feels true

You better believe for you I've cried (I've cried, I've cried)
High tides (high tides, high tides)
'Cause I want you so bad, but you can't fight fire with fire (ah-ah-ah)

Oh, I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop trying to be somebody else
Oh, I just want to love you, love you for free
Everybody wants something from me, you just want me

Listen, I know how low I can go, I give as good as I get
You get the brunt of it all 'cause you're all I've got left
Oh, I hope in time (hope in time)
We both will find (peace of mind) peace of mind
Sometimes the road less travelled is the road best left behind (ah-ah-ah)

Well, I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop trying to be somebody else
Oh, I just want to love you, love you for free, yeah
'Cause everybody wants something from me, you just want me

You better believe I'm trying (trying, trying)
To keep climbing (climbing, climbing)
But the higher we climb feels like we're both none the wiser

(The only regret I have)
(I wish that it was just at a different time)
(A most turbulent period of my life)
(Why would I put that on you?)
(That's just like a very heavy thing to have to talk about)

(But because of that period of time)
(Even though it was so much fun)
(I didn't get to go on and to make new memories with him)
(There was just memories in a big storm)


Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move
And everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
'Cause nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me

You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

It's hard to admit that
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care?

It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old
It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young


When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any sins
I had no idea of the state we were in

I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head

But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memory?
'Cause I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know

But I know I have a fickle heart and bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head

But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

I gave you the space so you could breathe
And I kept my distance so you would be free
And hoped that you'd find the missing piece
To bring you back to me

Why don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

When will I see you again?


My little love
I see your eyes widen like an ocean
When you look at me
So full of my emotions

I'm findin' it hard
To be here sincerely
I know you feel lost
It's my fault completely

Tell me you love me
I love you a million, by fact

I don't recognize myself
In the coldness of the day light
So I ain't surprised
You can read through all of my lies

I feel so bad to be here
When I'm so guilty
I'm so far gone
And you're the only one who can save me

Oi, I feel like you don't lovе me
Why do you feel like that?
Do you like me?
You know mommy doesn't like
Anyone else like I like you, right?

I'm holdin' on (barely)
Mama's got a lot to learn (it's heavy)
I'm holdin' on (catch me)
Mama's got a lot to learn (teach me)

Mommy’s been having
A lot of big feelings recently
Like how?
Just like, I'm, I'm
The feeling that I have, like
Hm, I feel a bit confused

Why?
I don't know
And I feel like
I don't really know what I'm doing
Oh, at all?
At all
And that would make me go

My little love
Tell me, do you feel
The way my past aches?
When you lay on me
Can you hear the way my heart breaks?

I wanted you to have
Everything I never had
I'm so sorry if what I've done
Makes you feel sad

I love your dad 'cause he gave you to me
You're half me and you're half daddy

I'm holdin' on (barely)
Mama's got a lot to learn (it's heavy)
I'm holdin' on (catch me)
Mama's got a lot to learn (teach me)

I'm having a bad day
I'm having a very anxious day
I feel very paranoid
I feel very stressed

Um, I have a hangover
Which never helps, but
I feel like today is the first day
Since I left that, I feel lonely

And I never feel lonely
I love being on my own
I always preferred being on my own
Than being with people

And I feel like maybe I've been
Like, overcompensating
Being out and stuff like that
To keep my mind off of him

And I feel like today I'm home
And I wanna be at home
I just wanna watch TV
And curl up in a ball and

Be in my sweats and stuff like that
I just feel really lonely
I feel a bit frightened
That I might feel like this at all


She, she ain't real
She ain't gonna be able
To love you like I will

She is a stranger
You and I have history
Or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all
But, baby, is that really what you want?

Bless your soul
You've got your head in the clouds
She made a fool out of you
And, boy, she's bringing you down

She made your heart melt
But you're cold to the core
Now rumour has it
She ain't got your love anymore

Rumour has it, ooh
Rumour has it, ooh
Rumour has it, ooh
Rumour has it, ooh

Rumour has it, ooh
Rumour has it, ooh
Rumour has it, ooh
Rumour has it, ooh

She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed
I heard you've been missing me

You've been telling people
Things you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out
And she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumours?

Bless your soul
You've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me
And, boy, you're bringing me down

You made my heart melt
Yet I'm cold to the core
But rumour has it
I'm the one you're leaving her for

Rumour has it, ooh
Rumour has it, ooh
Rumour has it, ooh
Rumour has it, ooh

Rumour has it, ooh
Rumour has it, ooh
Rumour has it, ooh
Rumour has it, ooh

All of these words whispered in my ear
Tell a story that I cannot bare to hear
Just 'cause I said it
It don't mean that I meant it

People say crazy things
Just 'cause I said it
Don't mean that I meant it
Just 'cause you heard it

Rumour has it, ooh
Rumour has it, ooh
Rumour has it, ooh
Rumour has it, ooh

Rumour has it, ooh
Rumour has it, ooh
Rumour has it, ooh
Rumour has it, ooh

Rumour has it, ooh
Rumour has it, ooh
Rumour has it, ooh
Rumour has it, ooh

Rumour has it, ooh
Rumour has it, ooh
But rumour has it
He's the one
I'm leaving you for


I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
And bear my soul

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother; I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
A million years ago


I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong, I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust
I know this is love

But if I tell the world
I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do
If I end up with you

Should I give up?
Or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste
Even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?

Should I give up?
Or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

I build myself up
And fly around in circles
Waitin' as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally, could this be it

Or should I give up?
Or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste
Even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?

Should I give up?
Or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

Should I give up?
Or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste
Even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?

Should I give up?
Or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Ooh, oh

Should I give up?
Or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste
Even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?

Should I give up?
Or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?


If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?

And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh, honey if I'm not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?

It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Oh, oh
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Oh, oh
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

Oh, oh (say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
(Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
(Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)

Oh, oh (say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
(Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
(Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)

Say that our love ain't water under the bridge


Hold on
You are still strong
Love will soon come
Just hold on

Oh, what have I done yet again?
Have I not learned anything?
I don't want to live in chaos
It's like a ride that I want to get off

It's hard to hold on to who I am
When I'm stumbling in the dark for a hand
I am so tired of battling
With myself, with no chance to win

(Hold on)
Let time be patient
(You are still strong)
Let pain be gracious
(Love will soon come)
Just hold, hold on

I swear to God I am such a mess
The harder that I try, I regress
I'm my own worst enemy
Right now I truly hate being me

Every day feels like the road I'm on
Might just open up and swallow me whole
How do I feel so mighty small
When I'm struggling to feel at all?

(Just hold on) just hold on
Let time be patient
(You are still strong) you are still strong
Let pain be gracious
(Love will soon come)
Just hold on (you, just hold on, you, just hold on)
Hold on (you, just hold on, just hold on)

Sometimes loneliness
Is the only rest we get
(Just hold on, just hold on)
And the emptiness
Actually lets us forget (just hold on, just hold on)

Sometimes forgiveness
Is easiest in secret (just hold on, just hold on)
So just hold on, ooh

(Just hold on) let time be patient and
(You are still strong)
Let pain be gracious
(Love will soon come) baby
If you just hold on

(Hold on) hold on, hold on, hold on
Just let time be patient
'Cause you're still strong
You're still strong (you are still strong)
Just be gracious
Love will soon come
If you just hold on

(You, just hold on, you, just hold on, you, just hold on)
Just be patient, just be patient
(You, just hold on, you, just, just hold on)
(You, just hold on, you, just hold on, just hold on)


Hold me closer one more time
Say that you love me in your last goodbye
Please forgive me for my sins
Yes, I swam dirty waters
But you pushed me in
I've seen your face under every sky
Over every border and on every line
You know my heart more than I do
We were the greatest, me and you

But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better to you

Let me stay here for just one more night
Build your world around me
And pull me to the light
So I can tell you that I was wrong
I was a child then, but now I'm willing to learn

But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried

I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better to you

Time against us
Miles between us
Heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
Time against us
Miles between us
Heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
I know I left you speechless
I'll be waiting

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better to you


Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again

However far away
I will always love you
However long I stay
I will always love you
Whatever words I say
I will always love you
I will always love you

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again

However far away
I will always love you
However long I stay
I will always love you
Whatever words I say
I will always love you
I will always love you

However far away
I will always love you
However long I stay
I will always love you
Whatever words I say
I will always love you
I always love you
I always love you
'Cause I love you


I know you've got things to do (I do too)
I just wanna spend all my time with you (feels so good)
I'm so hard to impress
Don't leave me on this stretch alone
When I'm out at a party
I'm just excited to get home
And dream about you
All night long

I don't know how you got through to me (I'm so cold)
It's all happening so easily (like, oh my God)
It's so hard to digest
Usually I'm best alone
But every time that you text
I want to get on the next flight home
And dream next to you
All night long

Maybe it's the way you remind me of (where I come from)
Or how you made me feel beautiful (and thеn some)
The sight of you is dramatic
One glimpsе and I panic inside
I get lost in our hours
'Cause you possess powers I can't fight
That's why I dream about you
All night long
All night long
All night


Do you think of me when you lay with her?
Do you wonder who we’d be or even who we were?
Does she know where you sleep when you’re holding me?
In the heart of the city is it really what it seems to be?

You’re not just another love
I get sick and tired of
Spinning in your circles always brings me back to you
Make me feel like growing up
I can’t ever get enough
Of spinning in your circles

You’re not another love (another, oh, anothеr)
Not another love (another, oh, anothеr)
Not another love (another, oh, another)
Not another love (another, oh, another)

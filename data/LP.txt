When you get older, plainer, saner
Will you remember all the danger we came from?
Burnin' like embers, fallin' tender
Long before the days of no surrender years ago
And will you know?

So smoke 'em if you got 'em, 'cause it's goin' down
All I ever wanted was you
I'll never get to heaven 'cause I don't know how

Let's raise a glass or two
To all the things I've lost on you, oh, oh
Tell me, are they lost on you? Oh, oh
Just that you could cut me loose, oh, oh
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Is that lost on you?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby, is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?

Wish that I could see the machinations
Understand the toil of expectations in your mind
Hold me like you never lost your patience
Tell me that you love me more than hate me all the time
And you're still mine

So smoke 'em if you got 'em, 'cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
Let's take a drink of heaven, this can turn around

Let's raise a glass or two
To all the things I've lost on you, oh, oh
Tell me, are they lost on you? Oh, oh
Just that you could cut me loose, oh, oh
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Is that lost on you?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby, is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?

(Lost on you)
(Lost on you)

Let's raise a glass or two
To all the things I've lost on you, oh, oh
Tell me, are they lost on you? Oh, oh
Just that you could cut me loose, oh, oh
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?

(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)


Hold on, I know you're scared
But you're so close to heaven
Eyes shut tight
Just pretend you're like a feather

Flew down the clouds together
But don't look down, not ever
Don't ask why
Just look out onto forever

All this time
You're just tryin' not to lose it
You can always learn to fly
You never do until you do it

Up high in the middle of nowhere
Don't know but you know when you get there
Walk slow and low on a tightrope
Hope it lasts but you know, you never know

Take a chance we can dance up in mid-air
Feel so good, I could die, but I don't care
Walk slow and low on a tightrope
Hope it lasts but you know, you never know

You never know

We're just a step from fearless
Reach out for me my dearest
Don't you cry
You don't know, you're almost near it

All this time
You're just tryin' not to lose it
You can always learn to fly
You never do until you do it

Up high in the middle of nowhere
Don't know but you know when you get there
Walk slow and low on a tightrope
Hope it lasts but you know, you never know

Take a chance we can last up in mid-air
Feel so good, I could die, but I don't care
Walk slow and low on a tightrope
Hope it lasts but you know, you never know

You never know
You never know
You never know
You never know

Up high in the middle of nowhere
Don't know but you know when you get there
Walk slow and low on a tightrope
Hope it lasts but you know, you never know

Take a chance we can dance up in mid-air
Feel so good, I could die, but I don't care
Walk slow and low on a tightrope
Hope it lasts but you know, you never know

Up high in the middle of nowhere
Don't know but you know when you get there
Walk slow and low on a tightrope
Hope it lasts but you know, you never know

You never know
You never know
You never know
You never know


There was a time, there was a life, I was inside my head
And finally I rested in your bed
The bars, the dives, the worst of vibes
I thought had come to pass
But still I couldn't seem to make it last

I'd swallow the Moon and the stars
To follow the beat of your heart

Oh-oh-oh, when we're high
Oh my God, you blow my mind
So let's get high
Live until we die, yeah

You and I (you and I)
Let's just do it one more time (one more time)
(A million times)
Let's get high (let's get high)
Live until we die (yeah)

A state of mind collected like
A slowly wound bouquet
With memories of our favorite nights and days

Let's swallow the Moon and the stars
Let's wallow just right where we are

Oh-oh-oh, when we're high
Oh my God, you blow my mind
So let's get high (let's get high)
Live until we die (yeah)

Oh, you and I (you and I)
Let's just do it one more time (one more time)
(A million times)
Let's get high (let's get high)
Live until we die, yeah

You blow my mind
You blow my mind

Oh my, my, kiss the sky
Jimmy, baby, you were right
She's so fine, hips don't lie
Hit me, baby, one more time
Go ahead and insert any random ass line
Go ahead, yeah

'Cause when we're high
Oh my God, you blow my mind
So let’s get high (let's get high)
Live until we die, yeah

You and I (you and I)
Let's just do it one more time (one more time)
(A million times)
Let's get high (let's get high)
Live until we die, yeah

Yeah (you blow my mind)
Live until we die (yeah)


I never tried to be a hero
You took us from the stars to zero

We had a love devout without a shred of doubt
We never worried 'bout other people
You broke the spell and wanted something else
Well, go fuck yourself with other people

Other people

No more song, no more dance, no dance floor
We left it all to chance, no encore

We had a love devout without a shred of doubt
We never worried 'bout other people
You broke the spell and wanted something else
Well, go fuck yourself with other people

Oh, baby, it's just your body
Go, let in on everybody
They won't be there when you're sorry
Other people

Oh, baby, it's just your body
Will it know that you love somebody?
Who won't be there when you're sorry?
Other people

Thank you, baby, thank you, babe, darling
Don't explain, don't explain
Thank you, baby, thank you, babe, darling
Don't explain, don't explain

We had a love devout without a shred of doubt
We never worried 'bout other people
You broke the spell and wanted something else
Well, now go fuck yourself with other people

Oh, baby, it's just your body
Go, let in on everybody
They won't be there when you're sorry
Other people

Oh, baby, it's just your body
Will it know that you love somebody?
Who won't be there when you're sorry?
Other people

Other people

Other people


Hey
Anyone can get love
Anyone can get laid
You know you're home
When you find the ones who stay
Brave enough not to tame
They let you burst into flames
Stoke the coals and then watch you blow

They're the ones make you trust in the universe
When you're lost and you're left and it's getting worse
They're the ones who you know will get you by

We are all strange
And It ain't never never ever gonna change
We are all strange
And it ain't never ever never gonna change

Hey
Anyone can get paid
Anyone can get saved
Everyday I still walk into the wild
The only thing I can see
The only real guarantee
Whenever I catch a knowing smile, yeah

They're the ones make you trust in the universe
When I'm lost and I'm left and it's getting worse
They're the ones I know will get me by

We are all strange
It ain't never ever ever gonna change
We are all strange
And it ain't never ever ever gonna change

We are all strange
But it ain't never ever never gonna change
We are all strange
And it ain't never never ever gonna change


Right on time as I was thinking I'm nowhere
I caught your vibe and you were takin’ me somewhere
And I can’t wait
Don’t hesitate
Hey, I can’t hide it
My face says what’s inside
And you take me every time

Just when I think the feeling’s gone
I can’t let go, I still belong
To a love that changes everything
You make me feel, you make think
To love
Love someone like you
To love
They’ll never be one like you
One like you

I can’t change the way the way you’re making me change, yeah
Well that’s ok, it’s in the things that you don’t say
But baby, please
Please believe me
I can’t fake it
It’s easy
I’ve seen you naked
Believe me
We’re gonna make it

Just when I think the feeling's gone
I can’t let go I still belong
To a love that changes everything
You make me feel you make think
To love
Love someone like you
To love
They’ll never be one like you
One like you

If it’s gone too far
When it’s gone too far
Then it’s gone too far
To be gone
If it’s what I want
And it’s what you want
If it’s what’s we want
Then it’s on

Oh oh oh

Just when I think the feeling's gone
I can’t let go I still belong
To a love that changes everything
You make me feel you make think
To love
Love someone like you
To love
They’ll never be one like you
One like you
One like you


We are kneeling at the river's edge and tempting
All the steps to follow closer right behind
Is it only when you feel a part is empty?
That it's gnawing at the corners of your mind

Oh, I will ask you for mercy
I will come to you blind
What you'll see is the worst me
Not the last of my kind

Oh, oh-oh
In the muddy water, we're falling
Oh, oh-oh
In the muddy water, we're crawling

Hold me down
Hold me now
Sold me out
In the muddy waters, we're falling

It is not clear why we choose the fire pathway
Where we end is not the way that we had planned
All the spirits gather 'round like it's our last day
To get across, you know we'll have to raise the sand

Oh, I will ask you for mercy
I will come to you blind
What you'll see is the worst me
Not the last of my kind

Oh, oh-oh
In the muddy water, we're falling
Oh, oh-oh
In the muddy water, we're crawling

Hold me down
Hold me now
Sold me out
In the muddy water, we're falling

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't fail me now
Put your arms around me and pull me out
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I know I'm found
With your arms around me, oh, save me now

Oh, oh-oh
In the muddy water, we're falling
Oh, oh-oh
In the muddy water, we're crawling

Hold me down
Hold me now
Sold me out
In the muddy water, we're falling


Now that you've got what you wanted
Now that you've got what you need
Girl, if we're gonna be honest
Honestly, what's left for me?

'Cause all I got
Is close but not
And all I want
Is to know just how

Try to be the fire for you
Try to be the Sun
Try to be your home and the place
That you come to

Babe, I took the whole world
And put it in your hands
I'm really trying hard
But I don't understand

Tell me, ooh
How to be the one that you love
Ooh, ooh
How to be the one that you love

Don't treat my love like a habit
Why don't you show me a way?
I'd give it to you, you can have it
I just wish I knew what to say

'Cause all I got
Is close but not
And all I want
Is to know just how

Try to be the fire for you
Try to be the Sun
Try to be your home and the place
That you come to

Babe, I took the whole world
And put it in your hands
I'm really trying hard
But I don't understand

Tell me, ooh
How to be the one that you love
Ooh, ooh
How to be the one
How to be the one
How to be the one

Try to be the fire for you
Try to be the Sun
Try to be your home and the place
That you come to

Babe, I took the whole world
And put it in your hands
I'm really trying hard
But I don't understand

How to be the one
Ooh, ooh
How to be the one that you love
Ooh, ooh
How to be the one that you love
Ooh, ooh
How to be the one that you love
Ooh, ooh
How to be the one (the one)
How to be the one that you love


Hey baby I worry ‘bout you all the time
I know we didn’t hold the light
But you are always on my mind

Yeah baby
They’ll tell you
It’ll be alright
They’ll tell you it’ll all be fine
But we’ve done all those lonesome lines

Drag this on it can’t be wrong
Stay
Say the long goodbye
Let’s relive the lie
It doesn’t have to be over
Stay
Say the long goodbye
Save me for a while
It doesn’t have to be over

I keep chasing
I know I'm just a dream away
I wish I found the words to say
Before our moment slipped away

Seems crazy
But looking back at all the pain
I’d bottle every drop of rain
To be the way we were again

Drag this on it can’t be wrong
Stay
Say the long goodbye
Let’s relive the lie
It doesn’t have to be over
Stay
Say the long goodbye
Save me for a while
I don’t want it to be over

Kiss a little longer
Catch a little fire
Nothing is forever
Don’t believe in time

Stay
Say the long goodbye
Let’s relive the lie
It doesn’t have to be over
Stay
Say the long goodbye
Save me for a while
I don’t want it to be over

Drag this on it can’t be wrong
Drag this on it can’t be wrong


Another verse, another search for something holy
Another chance to make it right
Oh, when it's young and it's fun
There's nothing lost, nothing won
And no consequence in sight

You know it only feels like darkness
When the light doesn't shine on your side
You were the poet, I was the poem
But were you mine? Were you your own?
Or were we fighting for our lives?
It doesn't matter, we survived

But If I could have
One last time with you
I imagine all the things we would do
Love is in the words unspoken
All these moments are golden
Forever is mine, with you

I ask the past
If nothing lasts, why don't you show me?
But I'm afraid to scare myself
'Cause where there's love, there is loss
And there you hang on the cross
With another tale to tell
And more wishes for the well

But If I could have
One last time with you
I imagine all the things we would do
Love is in the words unspoken
All these moments are golden
Forever is mine, with you

But If I could have
One last time with you
I imagine all the things we would do
Love is in the words unspoken
All these moments are golden
Forever is mine, with you

You know it only feels like darkness
'Till somebody turns on the light
I'd live it all once again
With an alternate end
And I'd pay the highest price
To hold you one last time


Take me with your eyes
Hold me like we're out of time
Drink me like the cheapest wine
And disappear in a day

I'm not going for the win
And I don't need to know where you've been
Ooh, 'cause what's happening is clandestine and amazing

No more waiting
I'm just saying
So amazing

Oh I
Everybody's falling in love right now
Oh I
Everybody's falling in love right now

Everybody's falling
Everybody's falling
Everybody's falling in love right now
Everybody's falling
Never saw it coming
Everybody's falling in love right now

What's your rising sign?
John, Paul, George or can't decide?
No, don't tell me nevermind
I wanna be surprised

Yeah, you know it's not that deep
Casual, no casualties
Just a little company
Can get you through this life

No more waiting
I'm just saying
So amazing

Oh I
Everybody's falling in love right now
Oh I
Everybody's falling in love right now

Everybody's falling
Everybody's falling
Everybody's falling in love right now
Chasing down the moment
Never saw it coming
Everybody's falling in love right now

Te amo, just enough, so you know
Just a touch of a heart I can hold
Te amo, just enough so let go
Everybody's falling in love
All I wanna know is your love
(Everybody's falling in love right now)

Oh I
Everybody's falling in love right now
Oh I
Everybody's falling in love right now

Everybody's falling
Everybody's falling
Everybody's falling in love right now
Chasing down the moment
Never saw it coming
Everybody's falling in love right now


Ooh, everything I want
You have been all along
Ooh, it's too much, I'm falling

I still think about you every day
Maybe two or three times, when I get carried away
I could never push rewind and erase
But at least I know now that it wasn't a phase

You're everything I want
And you have been all along
But ooh, it's too much
Too much, too much will never be enough
Whenever we touch, it happens every time
I have to turn around and run

Hold me closer and I'll try to forget
If I take a default, I will always regret
Hurting someone who will never suspect
Who isn't even aware that you could be such a threat

You're everything I want
And you have been all along
But ooh, it's too much
Too much, too much will never be enough
Whenever we touch, it happens every time
I have to turn around and run

Girl I can't take your love
I can't look back, I'll turn to dust
Baby I wish that I could have it all
But I don't, it's just too much

Ooh, too much
Is it going to be over
It's never over too much
Too much will never be enough
Whenever we touch, it happens every time
I have to turn around and run

Your love, I can't look back, I'll turn to dust
Baby I wish that I could have it all
But I don't, it's just too much
Too much, too much will never be enough
Whenever we touch, it happens every time
I have to turn around and run


I could be your North Star
I could be the love of your life
I could warm your cold heart
I could walk the edge of your knife
And when you think you're so high
I can always take you higher
You never can be too high
Fuck it, baby let's go higher

Every time I say: 'm sorry
I never wanna fight again
I never wanna hurt you honey
Remember when we were just friends?

So let me go wild
I wanna float, I wanna fly
My inner child
I only need it to survive
Let me go wild
I gotta flow, I gotta fly
Let me go wild
We're only running out of time
Out of time, oh, oh, oh
Time, time, time, oh, oh, oh

I could be your quick fix
I could be the catch for your fall
And when you need to get kicks
I can give the best of them all

'cause every time I say: I'm sorry
I never wanna fight again
And even if we end our story
Everything is just pretend

So let me go wild
I wanna float, I wanna fly
My inner child
I only need it to survive
Let me go wild
I gotta flow, I gotta fly
Let me go wild
We're only running out of time
Out of time, oh, oh, oh (Running out of time)
Time, time, time, oh, oh, oh (My inner child)
Time, time, time, oh oh oh

So let me go wild
(Out of time, oh, oh, oh)
So let me go wild
(Time, time, time, oh, oh, oh)
Out of time, oh, oh, oh
(Let me go wild)
Time, time, time, oh, oh, oh
(Running out of time)


Hush, hush
Don't say a word
The faint cries can hardly be heard
A storm lies beyond the horizon, barely

Don't stop
Sweep through the days
Like children that can't stay awake
Stay here untainted and say

Stay while the melody's sung
Break like a wave on the run
I do be sure I can't say anymore
I just know that it won't last forever

Rush, rush
Take me away
Like hourglass sand that never escapes
Stars are born and then die, but carefree

A small clock that ticks without time
And watched by an ocean of eyes
Ending, ascending and then

Stay while the melody's sung
Break like a wave on the run
I do be sure I can't say anymore
I just know that it won't last
I just know that it won't last forever


My room is dark, the blinds are shut tight
And everything is still too much outside
It may be over, but not tonight
I may be older, but I still cry

I can't stop sleeping in your clothes
You can't stop calling on the phone

Can't you see I'm in recovery?
Just let it be, I'm in recovery, ooh

I'm holding on, I know I'm almost there
So don't reach out and tell me that you care
I'm finally sober, I see the light
The worst is over, nobody died

I'm still tryin' to let you go
Oh, baby, please, leave me alone

Can't you see I'm in recovery?
Just let it be, I'm in recovery, ooh
I know you wanna say you're sorry
But I don't wanna hear that story
And I don't wanna be a fool anymore
Can't you see I'm in recovery?

I always thought you'd be the one
Who always needed me
My home, you'd be my home
Suddenly, you're memory
And time is like an enemy, so cold

Can't you see I'm in recovery?
I know you wanna say you're sorry
But I already heard that story
And I don't wanna be a fool anymore

Can't you see I'm in recovery?


I've been caged, I've been hounded, I've been hunted and tamed
I'm the outlaw of outside and ready to rage
I'm in search of the heart I can eat to renew me, yeah
And I'm dazzled by all of the things that undo me

Girls go wild on the West Coast
Come on, baby, let's go, that's what she said
Sunshine brighter than blind love
It's all in the name of the Wild, Wild West

Take my love, take my soul, you just take what you can
When we fuck now, it feels like you don't understand
Tell you what, it don't suck, and I need you right now, yeah
You're the one that I want, so I won't make a sound

Girls go wild on the West Coast
Come on baby, let's go, that's what she said
Sunshine brighter than blind love
It's all in the name of the Wild, Wild West

I really love you
You know I really do
Whatever happens
I hope you're happy, too
I really love you
So what you wanna do?

Girls go wild on the West Coast
Come on, baby, let's go, that's what she said
Sunshine brighter than blind love
It's all in the name of the Wild, Wild West

I really love you
You know I really do
Whatever happens
I hope you're happy, too
I really love you
So what you wanna do?


Do you remember
Making love on the hill
At the top of Topanga?
Do you remember
A handful of pills
On a midnight adventure?
I do, I do

Late in September
It started to end
And I felt you pretending
I couldn't surrender
Through the high and the low
I just wanted to love you
I do, I do

All of the hurt you've been hiding away
Cuts me at once like a Switchblade
So take every stab you can take
And I'll give it to ya, I'll give it to ya

I always knew that you'd cut me some day
I fell in love with a Switchblade
And I know that you did the same
So I'll give it to ya, give it to ya

We were electric
We were wild, we were free
And I thought that you meant it
It's hard to accept it
That it's not meant to be
But I'll never regret it
I don't, I don't

All of the hurt you'd been hiding away
Cuts me at once like a Switchblade
So take every stab you can take
And I'll give it to ya, give it to ya

I always knew that you'd cut me some day
I fell in love with a Switchblade
And I know that you did the same
So I'll give it to ya, give it to ya

Long live the beautiful hearts
Who find love and tear it apart
Long live the beautiful hearts
Who find love and tear it apart

All of the hurt you've been hiding away
Cuts me at once like a Switchblade
So take every stab you can take
And I'll give it to ya, give it to ya

I always knew that you'd cut me someday
I fell in love with a Switchblade
And I know that you did the same
So I'll give it to ya give it to ya


My mortal enemies
Are still my fantasies
They get the best of me and turn me from a friend to fiend
It’s such a tragedy because I wanna be
Back in that time when every melody was you and me

Gimme a love song
The words we used to sing before it went wrong
Gimme a love song
And I belong again
I belong, I belong to when we used to get along

Gimme a love song
Gimme a love song
Gimme a love song
Gimme a love song

I find my way to you no matter what I do
You’re in my car, you’re in my head, you’re in my attitude
And so suddenly
You’re singing back to me
I'm dancing to a beat I know

Gimme a love song
The ones we used to sing before it went wrong
Gimme a love song
And I belong again
I belong
I belong to when we used to get along

Gimme a love song
Gimme a love song
Gimme a love song
Gimme a love song
Gimme a love song
Gimme a love song


I've been looking for answers
I’ve been looking for change
I've been looking for dancers in the middle of the rain
It might seem a mile away
It might seem insane
You could be a smile away
You couldn't feel my pain

How do I reach you?
What’s undernath you?
Keeping you safe and sound
Found what I'm chasing
Heart's racing

When you're around it feels like
Angels over me
I've never seen them before
But I feel angels over me
I hear them sing: I love you more
I love you more, I love you more
I love you more, I love you more

Got the keys to the kingdom
And it feels like a cage
Had to look for the wisdom
Right there on the page
And are you kings and queens
And inbetweens
We're OK
Staying higher than the mezzanine
We're OK

How do I reach you?
What's undernath you?
Keeping you safe and sound
If you see me
Do they see me

When you’re around it feels like
Angels over me
I’ve never seen them before
But I feel angels over me
I hear them sing: I love you more
I love you more, I love you more

It's only a case of denial
That messes with my inner child
But you bring out the best in me
And fill me with ecstasy
Like I haven’t seen in a while

When you're around it feels like
Angels over me
I've never seen them before
But I feel angels over me
I hear them sing: I love you more
I love you more, I love you more

(When you're around it feels like)
Angels over me
I’ve never seen them before
But I feel angels over me
I hear them sing: I love you more
I love you more, I love you more
I love you more, I love you more


Remember those walls I built?
Baby, they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound

I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
It's the risk that I'm taking
And I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can feel your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can see your halo
I pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo

Hit me like a ray of Sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
And I'm addicted to your light

I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
It's the risk that I'm taking
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can feel your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo, halo
I pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo

So everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can feel your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo, halo

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo

Remember those walls I built?
Baby, they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound


You are my one desire
Who knew two waters make a fire sign?
And our worlds, though always in a spiral
Are taking me higher

It’s the truth that makes you melt
Path to heaven always goes through hell
I don’t like to kiss and tell
But you take me higher

Let’s have a conversation
It’s hanging in the air, I hang on every line
Let’s have a conversation
I know you really care and so do I

If you talk to me and look at me, and say another word to me
Just say what’s on your mind
Just talk to me and look at me, and say another word to me
Just say what’s on your mind

Oh-whoa
Let’s have a conversation
Oh-whoa
Let’s have a conversation

Chances are it will be hard
Let’s discuss what takes us far apart
I’ll admire you still from afar
I’ll never get tired

Let’s have a conversation
It’s hanging in the air, I hang on every line
Let’s have a conversation
I know you really care and so do I

If you talk to me and look at me, and say another word to me
Just say what’s on your mind
Just talk to me and look at me, and say another word to me
Just say what’s on your mind

Oh-whoa
Let’s have a conversation
Oh-whoa
Let’s have a conversation

It’s just communication
I need some patience
Oh
Just communication
Not a revelation

Let’s have a conversation
It’s hanging in the air, I hang on every line
Let’s have a conversation
I know you really care and so do I

If you talk to me and look at me, and say another word to me
Just say what’s on your mind
Just talk to me and look at me, and say another word to me
Just say what’s on your mind

(Let’s have a conversation
Let’s have a conversation)


Let's go back and talk about the beginning
And what we liked so much about each other then
And I hope you're happy with your ordinary life
It's the wrong place
The wrong time
The darkside

Hoppin' bars in the summertime
And no one cared if you lost your mind
But you were not amused, no you were not amused
I hope you're happy with your ordinary life
It's the wrong place
The wrong time
The darkside

I wanted to say the right thing - I really did
But I know you're right
And I hope you're happy with your ordinary life


Now here you go again,
You say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness
Like a heartbeat, heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness, in the stillness of remembering of what you had
Lonely
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women they will come and they will go
When the rain washed you clean, you'll know
you'll know
Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams and
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness
Like a heartbeat, heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness, in the stillness of remembering of what you had
Lonely
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Played only love you when they're playing
Women they will come and they will go
When the rain washed you clean, you'll know
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say women they will come and they will go
When the rain washed you clean, you'll know
You'll know
You'll know


Burnt down cigarettes
Faded blues and gray I'm feeling so worn
I've seen better days
You're so beautiful
My eyes have never seen
All the times
I've tried to figure out my dreams
I can't stand another man
So where am I going down
You're gonna follow me baby
Follow me down

Warm rain wash away
Did you get your money's worth?
Don't try to trick me baby
I been here first
I didn't plan on this
It took a turn for the worse
Oh, but I need you with me to try and lift this curse

I can't stand another man
So where am I going now
You're gonna follow me baby
Follow me down

Burnt down cigarettes
Faded blues and gray
I am feeling so worn
I seen better days
You're so beautiful
My eyes have never seen
All the times I've tried
To figure out my dreams
I can't stand another man
So where am I going now
You're gonna follow me baby
Follow me down

I can't stand another man
Where am I going now
You better follow me baby
Follow me down, down, down


How do I get you outta my head?
How do I get you back in my bed?
Oh no
Tell me you're crazy, tell me you're scared
Tell me you still love what you had
Oh no

When there's no more sins to care about
And the hard rain dark times pour on down
When it's all been said and done
No one can save me

Oh, bear me no witness
Oh, oh, oh, bear me no witness
Tell me now how many highs can get me so down
'Cuz it don't matter how many times I go round, oh, oh, oh
Help me, Lord, bear me no witness

No one can save me, love me or hate me
I'll keep on waiting, nothing I won't do
Take you, my love like a street cut drug
Never know what you're really made of
Oh lord, oh lord

When there's no more sins to care about
And the hard rain dark times pour on down
When it's all been said and done
No one can save me

Oh, bear me no witness
Hear me now
Oh, oh oh, bear me no witness
Tell me how many highs can get us so down
'Cause it don't matter how many times we go 'round
Oh, oh oh, bear me no witness

No one can save me, love me or hate me
No one can save me, love me or hate me
No one can save me, love me or hate me
No one can save me, love me or hate me

When there's no more sins to care about
And the hard rain dark times pour on down
When it's all been said and done
No one can save me

Oh, bear me no witness
Hear me now
Oh, oh oh, bear me no witness

Oh, bear me no witness
Hear me now
Oh, oh oh, bear me no witness
Hear me now
Oh, bear me no witness
Hear me now
Oh, oh oh, bear me no witness


I never tried to be a hero
You took us from the stars to zero

We had a love devout without a shred of doubt
We never worried 'bout other people
You broke the spell and wanted something else
Well, go fuck yourself with other people

Other people

No more song, no more dance, no dance floor
We left it all to chance, no encore

We had a love devout without a shred of doubt
We never worried 'bout other people
You broke the spell and wanted something else
Well, go fuck yourself with other people

Oh, baby, it's just your body
Go, let in on everybody
They won't be there when you're sorry
Other people

Oh, baby, it's just your body
Will it know that you love somebody?
Who won't be there when you're sorry?
Other people

Thank you, baby, thank you, babe, darling
Don't explain, don't explain
Thank you, baby, thank you, babe, darling
Don't explain, don't explain

We had a love devout without a shred of doubt
We never worried 'bout other people
You broke the spell and wanted something else
Well, now go fuck yourself with other people

Oh, baby, it's just your body
Go, let in on everybody
They won't be there when you're sorry
Other people

Oh, baby, it's just your body
Will it know that you love somebody?
Who won't be there when you're sorry?
Other people

Other people

Other people

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said: Don't mind, but what do you mean: I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me: Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girl's hearts
My mother always told me: Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do, 'cause the lie becomes the truth

The Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and for forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)

She told: My baby, we danced 'til three
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo: My baby cried
His eyes were like mine
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me: Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
But she came and stood right by me
Just to smell her sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

The Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

The Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

The Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
(No, she is not just my baby)
But the kid is not my son

She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
(You know what you did)
She says he is my son
(Breaking my heart, babe)
She says I am the one

The Billie Jean is not my lover
The Billie Jean is not my lover
The Billie Jean is not my lover
The Billie Jean is not my lover
(Call me, Billie Jean)
The Billie Jean is not my lover
(She is not at the scene)

The Billie Jean is not my lover

Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be?
You're not here with me

You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away?
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

'Lone, 'lone
Why? 'Lone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms

I can hear your prayers
Your burdens, I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away?
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

Oh, whisper three words and I'll come runnin', flyin'
And, girl, you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

You are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

You are not alone (you are not alone)
I am here with you (I am here with you)
Though you're far away (though you're far away)
I am here to stay
But you are not alone (you are always in my heart)
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone (not alone, oh)

You are not alone, you are not alone
Say it again
You are not alone, you are not alone
Not alone, not alone

If you just reach out for me, girl
In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone
You and me, not alone, oh

Together, together
Not not being alone
Not not being alone

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurkin' in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight

You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the Sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while
You hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're out of time

'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with the forty eyes, girl
(Thriller)
(Thriller night)
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
(They're open wide)
This is the end of your life

They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

That this is thriller
Thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghost would ever dare try
(Thriller)
(Thriller night)
So let me hold you tight
And share a
(Killer, diller, chiller)
(Thriller here tonight)

'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghost would ever dare try
(Thriller)
(Thriller night)
So let me hold you tight
And share a
(Killer, thriller)

I'm gonna thrill you tonight

Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller night, thriller))
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Ooh, babe, I'm gonna thrill you tonight

They told him: Don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear
The fire's in their eyes
And their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it

You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man (oh)
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (beat it)
Just beat it (beat it)
Just beat it (beat it)
Just beat it (beat it) (uh)

They're out to get you
Better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive? Better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it (oh)

You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life
This ain't no truth or dare (oh)
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you
Then they'll tell you: It's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be
Much brighter than tomorrow

And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel
There's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make it a better place
For you and for me

If you want to know why
There's love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares of joyful giving

If we try, we shall see
In this bliss
We cannot feel fear or dread
We stop existing and start living

Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
Make a better world

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this Earth, crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly, be God's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel
You are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together, we'll cry happy tears

See the nations turn their swords
Into plowshares
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me
You and for me

I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me
Pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream (washed-out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change!

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (oh, yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (come on, change)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (you can't)
Then you close your mind (close your, your mind)

(That man, that man) I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(That man, that man) oh, yeah
(That man, that man) I'm asking him to change his ways
(That man, you know it) and no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na

Gonna feel real good (oh, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh, no

I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good, sha'mon (change)
Just lift yourself, you know
You've got to start with yourself (yeah)

(Make that change) I gotta make that change today
(Man in the mirror) you got to
You got to, you got to not pick yourself, brother (yeah)
You know (make that change)
I've gotta get that man, that man (man in the mirror)

You got to, you got to move, sha'mon, sha'mon
You got to stand up (yeah), stand up (make that change)
Stand up, stand up and lift yourself now (man in the mirror)
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know (change)
Make that change

My life will never be the same
'Cause, girl, you came and changed
The way I walk
The way I talk

I cannot explain the things I feel for you
But, girl, you know it's true
Stay with me, fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you need

Feels so right (girl)
I've searched for the perfect love all my life
All my life
Feels like I (like I)
Have finally found a perfect love this time (see)
And I finally found, come on, girl

You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own, I give (you rocked my world)
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (you rocked my world)

You rocked my world, you know you did (girl)
And everything I own I give (I want you, girl)
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

In time, I knew that love would bring
This happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I waited patiently

Girl, you know it seems
My life is fully complete
Our love is true because of you
Keep doing what you do

Think that I
Finally, found the perfect love
I've searched for all my life (searched for all my life)
Think I'd find
Such a perfect love that's awesomely, so right (whoa, girl)

You rocked my world, you know you did (come on)
And everything I own I give (come on, come on, come on)
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find (girl)
Someone like you to call mine (you rocked my world)

And everything I own I give (girl, girl, girl)
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (girl)

And everything I own I give
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

Girl, I know that this is love
I felt the magic's all in the air
And girl, I'll never get enough
That's why I always have to have you here

You rocked my world, you know you did (you rocked my world)
And everything I own I give
(Look what you did to me baby, yeah)
The rarest love (yeah, yeah), who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (you rocked my world)

You rocked my world, you know you did (know you did, baby)
And everything I own, I give ('cause you rocked my world)
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

You rocked my world
(You rocked my world, you know you did)
The way you talk to me
The way you're lovin' me
The way you give it to me

(You rocked my world, you know you did)
Give it to me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
(You rocked my world, you know you did)

You rocked my world
You rocked my world
You rocked my world
You rocked my world
Come on, girl

You rocked my world, you know you did (come on, girl)
And everything I own, I give (baby, baby, baby)
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

The rarest love, who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

Heehee, oh!
Go on, girl!
Aow!
Heh!

Hey, pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like I've never, ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk, your talk, your dress

I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me baby and tell me twice
That you're the one for me

The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet

My lonely days are gone

Uh, uh

I like the feelin' you're givin' me
Just hold me, baby, and I'm in ecstasy
Oh, I'll be workin' from 9 to 5
To buy you things, to keep you by my side

I've never felt so in love before
Just promise, baby, you'll love me forever more
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me

The way you make me feel

What about rain?
What about all the things
That you said we were to gain?

What about killing fields?
Is there a time?
What about all the things
That you said was yours and mine?

All the blood we've shed before?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores?

All the children dead from war?

I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know we've drifted far

Ah, ooh

As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet

She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sign at the window
Then he struck you, a crescendo, Annie

He came into your apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
Then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down, it was your doom

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

You've been hit by
You've been hit by
A smooth criminal

Aaow!

So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him
There were no clues, they’re behind him
And they end up never knowing
Who’s the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidations

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?

Then he struck you, a crescendo, Annie (I don't know)

He came into your apartment (I don't know)
Left bloodstains on the carpet (I don't know why, baby)
And then you ran into the bedroom (help me)
You were struck down
It was your doom, Annie (dag gone it)

Annie are you okay? (Dag gone it, baby)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (Dag gone it, baby)
There's a sound at the window (dag gone it, baby)

Then he struck you, a crescendo, Annie (hoo! Hoo!)

He came into your apartment (dag gone it)
Left bloodstains on the carpet (hoo!)
And then you ran into the bedroom (hoo! Hoo!)
You were struck down (dag gone it)

I don't know, bet you wanna try
Every time you see

Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

Do you remember (I bet you remember)
Back in the fall? (I bet you remember)
We'd be together all day long (I bet you remember)
Do you remember (I bet you remember)
Us holding hands? (I bet you remember)
In each other's eyes, we'd stare (I bet you remember)

Tell me, do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?

Do you remember how we used to talk?
You know we'd stay on the phone at night till dawn
Do you remember all the things we said?
Like: I love you so
I'll never let you go

Do you remember (I bet you remember)
Back in the spring? (I bet you remember)
Every morning, birds would sing (I bet you remember)
Do you remember (I bet you remember)
Those special times? (I bet you remember)
They'll just go on and on (I bet you remember)
In the back of my mind (I bet you remember)

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?

Those sweet memories will always be dear to me
And, girl, no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now, baby!

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?

In the park, on the beach
Remember the time
You and me in Spain

Remember the time
Do you? Do you?

I gave her money
I gave her time
I gave her everything
Inside one heart could find

I gave her passion
My very soul
I gave her promises
And secrets so untold

And she promised me forever
And a day we'd live as one
We made our vows
We'd live a life anew

And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all the time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night

Don't you judge of my composure
Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find someone else

(Who is it) it is a friend of mine?
(Who is it) is it my brother?
(Who is it) somebody hurt my soul now
(Who is it) I can't take this stuff no more

I am the damned
I am the dead
I am the agony inside
The dying head

This is injustice
Woe unto thee
I pray this punishment
Would have mercy on me

And she promised me forever
That we'd live our life as one
We made our vows
We'd live a love so true

It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see what will I do

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night

Don't you judge of my composure
Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

(Who is it) it is a friend of mine?
(Who is it) is it my brother?
(Who is it) somebody hurt my soul now
(Who is it) I can't take it cause I'm lonely

(Hey, hey, hey)


(Who is it) it is a friend of mine?
(Who is it) to me I'm bothered
(Who is it) somebody hurt my soul now
(Who is it) I can't take it cause I'm lonely

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night

Don't you judge of my composure
Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find someone else

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night

Don't you judge of my composure
Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night

Don't you judge of my composure
Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find someone else

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night

Don't you judge of my composure
Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night

Don't you judge of my composure
Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night

Don't you judge of my composure
Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find someone else

Girl, close your eyes
Let that rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothin' that you can do
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine

You gotta feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

I wanna rock with you (all night)
Dance you into day (sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (all night)
We're gonna rock the night away (rock, right)

Out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us
Girl, when you dance
There's a magic that must be love
Just take it slow
'Cause we got so far to go

When you feel that heat
And we're gonna ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

I wanna rock with you (all night)
Dance you into day (sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (all night)

And when the groove is dead and gone (yeah)
You know that love survives
So we can rock forever

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight

But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none
And I told 'em about equality
And it's true, either you're wrong or you're right

But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

[L.T.B.]
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye

But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said: If you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said: If you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

Oh, oh
Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah

It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by (yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white

It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by (yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white

Ben, the two of us need look no more
We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I'll never be alone
And you, my friend, will see
You've got a friend in me
(You've got a friend in me)

Ben, you are always running here and there (here and there)
You feel you're not wanted anywhere (anywhere)
If you ever look behind
And don't like what you find
There's something you should know
You've got a place to go
(You've got a place to go)

I used to say: I and me
Now it's: Us, now it's: We
(I used to say: I and me)
(Now it's: Us, now it's: We)

Ben, most people would turn you away (turn you away)
I don't listen to a word they say (a word they say)
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I am sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like Ben

(A friend)
Like Ben
(Like Ben)
Like Ben

You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?

I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time, you won't seduce me

She's saying: That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need

She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says: There's no turning back
She trapped me in her heart

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Let me be

Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no

She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan
After the curtain comes down

She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree

She's saying: That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt

And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

Dirty Diana
It's Diana-iana-iana
Come on

She said: I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired, you see
But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me?

I said: My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright

Diana walked up to me
She said: I'm all yours tonight
At that, I ran to the phone
Saying: Baby, I'm alright

I said: But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key
She said: He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

Smile,
Though your heart is aching
Smile,
Even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by

If you smile
With your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just

Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear maybe ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile,
What's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just

Smile,
Though your heart is aching
Smile,
Even though it's breakin'
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by

If you smile
Through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

That's the time
You must keep on trying
Smile,
What's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

Tell the angels no, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's the chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

You're beautiful, you're wonderful, incredible, I love you so

You're beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you, girl, it's incredible
And I don't know what I'd do, if I can't be with you
The world could not go on
So every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn't wanna go if I can't see your face, can't hold you close
What good would Heaven be
If the angels came for me? I'd tell them no

No, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's the chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

Unthinkable
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you'd be moving on
I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Can't stand to see nobody kissing, touching her
Couldn't take nobody loving you the way we were
What good would Heaven be
If the angels come for me I'd tell them no

No, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's the chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

Oh no, can't be without my baby
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
Ooh
Oh no, can't be without my baby
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
Ooh

No, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's the chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

Just leave us alone, leave us alone
Please leave us alone

I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone
And so was I, so I asked her for her name
She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that was really into me

She said she didn't have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (she was lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Sad at home, she didn't have no phone (she was wantin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty-nine was the code she gave (she was lovin' me)
She lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me
Yeah

I never would've thought she was living like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near she would tell me how she feels
It felt so real to me
This girl, she had to be
An angel sent from heaven just for me

She said she didn't have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (she was lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Sad at home, she didn't have no phone (she was wantin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty-nine was the code she gave
She lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me
Yeah

She tried to live a double life (she was lovin' me)
Lovin' me while she was still your wife (she was wantin' me)
She thought that lovin' me was cool
While you at work and the kids at school (she was lovin' me)
She said that it would never end
Tried to get me any way she can (she was wantin' me)
She lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she got a family, family
Yeah

Why? No, alright

I didn't know she was already spoken for
'Cause I'm not that kind of man
I swear that I would have never looked her way
Now I feel so much shame
And now things have to change
You should know that I'm holding her to blame

She said she didn't have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (holdin' her to blame)
She told me she was all alone
Sad at home, she didn't have no phone (holdin' her to blame)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty-nine was the code she gave (holdin' her to blame)
She lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me
Yeah (holdin' her to blame)

She tried to live a double life
Lovin' me while she was still your wife (holdin' her to blame)
She thought that lovin' me was cool
While you at work and the kids at school (holdin' her to blame)
She said that it would never end
Tried to get me any way she can (holdin' her to blame)
She lied to you, lied to me

Yeah

Raised the kids the very best she can (she was lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone

Fifty-nine was the code she gave
She lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me
Yeah (She was lovin' me)

Yeah

You're throwin' stones to hide your hands

Then won't you slap my face?

Sha'mon (really, really bad)
You know I'm bad (bad), I'm bad (bad)

Who's bad?

Looking out across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs

Get me out into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

If they say: Why? Why?
Tell them that it's human nature
Why? Why does he do me that way?
If they say: Why? Why?
Tell them that it's human nature
Why? Why does he do me that way?

Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

If they say: Why? Why?
Just tell them that it's human nature
Why? Why does he do me that way?
If they say: Why? Why?
(She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why? Why does he do me that way?

I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
(That way) why? Oh, why?
(That way) why? Oh, why?

Looking out across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

If they say: Why? Why?
Tell them that it's human nature
Why? Why does he do me that way?
If they say: Why? Why?
(She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Oh, tell 'em!
Why? Why does he do me that way?

If they say: Why? Why?
Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha (why? Why?)
Oh, why? Why does he do me that way?

If they say: Why? Why?
(She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Oh, tell 'em!
Why? Why does he do me that way?
If they say: Why? Why?
Oh, tell 'em!
Why? Why does he do me that way?

If they say: Why? Why?
(She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Why? Why does he do me that way?

I like living this way
Why? Oh, why? (That way)
Why? Oh, why? (That way)
Why? Oh, why? (That way)

Thriller night, babe

The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller

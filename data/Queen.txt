Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality

Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy
I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows
Doesn't really matter to me
To me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Mama! Ooh!
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on
As if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody
I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind
And face the truth

Mama! Ooh!
(Anyway the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche! Scaramouche!
Will you do the fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning
Very, very frightening me!
Galileo! Galileo!
Galileo! Galileo!
Galileo, Figaro!
Magnifico!

I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
(He's just a poor boy from a poor family)
(Spare him his life, from this monstrosity)

Easy come, easy go
Will you let me go?

Bismillah!
No, we will not let you go!
(Let him go!)
Bismillah!
We will not let you go!
(Let him go!)
Bismillah!
We will not let you go!
(Let me go!)
Will not let you go!
(Let me go!)
Never, never let you go!
Never, never, never let me go!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia!
Mamma mia, let me go!
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me!
For me!
For me!

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby!
Can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out
Just gotta get right outta here!

Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!

Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me

Anyway the wind blows

Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart
And now you leave me

Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me (means to me)

Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love (all my love)
And now desert me

Love of my life, can't you see? (Please, bring it)
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

You will remember
When this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older
I will be there at your side
To remind you how I still love you (I still love you)

Hurry back, hurry back
Please, bring it back home to me
Because you don't know
What it means to me (means to me)

Love of my life
Love of my life
Ooh, ooh

Tonight, I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world, I'll turn it inside out, yeah!
I'm floating around in ecstasy
So don't stop me now
Don't stop me

'Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time
I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by, like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go
There's no stopping me
I'm burning through the sky, yeah!
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you

Don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call
Don't stop me now ('cause I'm havin' a good time)
Don't stop me now (yes, I'm havin' a good time)
I don't wanna stop at all

I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars
On a collision course
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
I am a sex machine ready to reload
Like an atom bomb about to
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode

I'm burning through the sky, yeah!
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you

Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me
Hey, hey, hey
Don't stop me, don't stop me, ooh, ooh, ooh
I like it
Don't stop me, don't stop me
Have a good time, good time
Don't stop me, don't stop me

Ooh, I'm burning through the sky, yeah!
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you

Don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call
Don't stop me now ('cause I'm havin' a good time)
Don't stop me now (yes, I'm havin' a good time)
I don't wanna stop at all

I want to break free
I want to break free
I want to break free from your lies
You're so self satisfied, I don't need you
I've got to break free
God knows, God knows I want to break free

I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love for the first time
And this time I know it's for real
I've fallen in love, yeah
God knows, God knows I've fallen in love

It's strange, but it's true, yeah
I can't get over the way you love me like you do
But I have to be sure
When I walk out that door
Oh, how I want to be free, baby
Oh, how I want to be free
Oh, how I want to break free

But life still goes on
I can't get used to living without, living without
Living without you by my side
I don't want to live alone, hey
God knows, got to make it on my own
So, baby, can't you see?
I've got to break free

I've got to break free
I want to break free, yeah
I want, I want, I want, I want to break free

Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street, gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face, you big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place

Singing
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you're a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street, gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face, you big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place

We will, we will rock you
Sing it!
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you're an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes, gonna make you some peace someday
You got mud on your face, you big disgrace
Somebody better put you back into your place

We will, we will rock you
Sing it!
We will, we will rock you

Everybody
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime

And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through
And we mean to go on and on and on and on

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions of the world

I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune
And everything that goes with it
I thank you all

But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose
And we mean to go on and on and on and on

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions of the world

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions

Pressure, pushing down on me
Pressing down on you
No man ask for

Under pressure
That burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

Um, ba, ba, be
Um, ba, ba, be
De, day, da
Ee, day, da
That's okay

It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming: Let me out
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

Day, day, de, mm, hm
Da, da, da, ba, ba
Okay

Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
Ee, do, ba, be
Ee, da, ba, ba, ba
Um, bo, bo
Be, lap

People on streets
Ee, da, de, da, de
People on streets
Ee, da, de, da, de, da, de, da

It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming: Let me out

Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Higher
High
Pressure on people, people on streets

Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love
But it's so slashed and torn
Why, why, why?
Love, love, love, love, love

Insanity laughs, under pressure we're breaking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love?

Give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love

'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And loves dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure

I can dim the lights and sing you songs
Full of sad things
We can do the tango just for two
I can serenade and gently play on your heart strings
Be your Valentino just for you

Oh love, oh lover boy
What're doing tonight? Hey, boy
Set my alarm, turn on my charm
That's because I'm a good old fashioned lover boy

Oh, let me feel you heartbeat (grow faster, faster)
Oh, can you feel my love heat? (Oh)
Come on and sit on my hot seat of love
And tell me how do you feel right after all

I'd like for you
And I to go romancing
Say the word, your wish is my command

Oh love, oh lover boy
What're doing tonight? Hey, boy
Write my letter, feel much better
And use my fancy patter on the telephone

When I'm not with you
Think of you always, I miss you
When I'm not with you
Think of me always
I love you, love you

Hey, boy, where did you get it from?
Hey, boy, where did you go?
I learned my passion
In the good old fashioned school of lover boys

Dining at the Ritz, we'll meet at nine precisely
(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine o'clock)
I will pay the bill, you taste the wine

Driving back in style
In my saloon will do quite nicely
Take me back to yours that will be fine
(Come on and get it)

Oh love, oh lover boy
What're doing tonight? Hey, boy
Everything is alright, just hold on tight
That's because I'm a good old fashioned (fashioned) lover boy

Can anybody find me somebody to love?

Ooh

Each morning I get up, I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
(Take a look at yourself in the mirror) take a look in the mirror
And cry (and cry)
Lord, what you're doing to me? (Yeah, yeah)
I have spent all my years in believing You
But I just can't get no relief, Lord

Somebody (somebody)
Ooh, somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

I work hard (he works hard)
Everyday of my life
I work till I ache my bones
At the end (at the end of the day)
I take home my hard-earned pay all on my own (goes home, goes home on his own)
I get down (down) on my knees (knees)
And I start to pray (praise the Lord)
Till the tears run down from my eyes, Lord

Somebody (somebody)
Ooh, somebody (please)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

(He wants help) every day (every day)
I try, and I try, and I try
But everybody wants to put me down, they say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
No, I got no common sense (he's got)
I got nobody left to believe
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Ooh, somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love? (Anybody)
(Find me someone to love) got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat (you just keep losing and losing)
I'm okay, I'm alright (he's alright, he's alright)
Ain't gonna face no defeat (yeah, yeah)
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Some day I'm gonna be free, Lord

Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love (find me, find me)
Find me somebody to love (find me)
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love-ove-ove (ooh, find me, find me)
Find me somebody to love (somebody to love)
Find me somebody to love

Somebody (somebody), somebody (somebody)
Somebody (find me), somebody find me somebody to love
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love (find me somebody)
Find me somebody to love (somebody, somebody, somebody to love)
Find me, find me, find me (find me, find me, find me, find me, find me)
Find me somebody to love (ooh, somebody to love)
Find me somebody to love (ooh, find me, find me, find me somebody to love)
Find me somebody to love (anybody, anywhere, anybody find me somebody to love)
Find me, find me, find me

Uh, let's go

Steve walks warily down the street
With his brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go

Are you ready, hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own

Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, look out

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

Hey

Oh, take it, bite the dust, bite the dust
Hey, another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust, ow
Another one bites the dust, hey, hey
Another one bites the dust, hah
Oh, shoot out

There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him
You can treat him bad and leave him
When he's down

But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound of the beat

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
Shoot out

Yeah, alright

This thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love

This thing (this thing) called love (called love)
It cries (like a baby)
In a cradle all night
It swings (woo woo)
It jives (woo woo)
It shakes all over like a jelly fish
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love

There goes my baby
She knows how to rock'n'roll
She drives me crazy

She gives me hot and cold fever
She leaves me in a cool cool sweat

I gotta be cool, relax, get hip!
Get on my track's
Take a back seat
Hitchhike
And take a long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love

I gotta be cool, relax, get hip!
Get on my track's
Take a back seat
Hitchhike
And take a long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready (ready, Freddie)
Crazy little thing called love

This thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah

Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah

Ooh, you make me live
Whatever this world can give to me
It's you, you're all I see
Ooh, you make me live now, honey
Ooh, you make me live

Ooh, you're the best friend that I ever had
I've been with you such a long time
You're my sunshine and I want you to know
That my feelings are true
I really love you
Oh, you're my best friend

Ooh, you make me live

Ooh, I've been wandering round
But I still come back to you (still come back to you)
In rain or shine
You've stood by me, girl
I'm happy at home
You're my best friend

Ooh, you make me live
Whenever this world is cruel to me
I got you to help me forgive
Ooh, you make me live now, honey
Ooh, you make me live

You're the first one
When things turn out bad
You know, I'll never be lonely
You're my only one
And I love the things
I really love the things that you do
Oh, you're my best friend

Ooh, you make me live

(I'm happy, I'm happy at home)
You're my best friend
Oh, you're my best friend
Ooh, you make me live
Ooh, you're my best friend

Empty spaces
What are we living for?
Abandoned places
I guess we know the score
On and on
Does anybody know what we are looking for?

Another hero
Another mindless crime
Behind the curtain
In the pantomime
Hold the line
Does anybody want to take it anymore?

The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Inside, my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile still stays on

Whatever happens
I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache
Another failed romance
On and on
Does anybody know what we are living for?

I guess I'm learning (I'm learning)
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning (turning, turning, turning)
Round the corner now
Outside, the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free

The show must go on
The show must go on (yeah, yeah)
Ooh, inside, my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile still stays on

(Yeah, yeah)
(Oh, oh, oh)

My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairytales of yesterday will grow, but never die
I can fly, my friends

The show must go on, yeah
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show

Ooh, I'll top the bill, I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
(On with the show)
(On with the show)
The show (the show must go on)

She keeps Moët et Chandon
In her pretty cabinet
Let them eat cake, she says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy
For Khrushchev and Kennedy
At anytime, an invitation
You can't decline

Caviar and cigarettes
Well-versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Recommended at the price
Insatiable in appetite
Wanna try?

To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah
Then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined

Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally)
For cars, she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Drop of a hat, she's as willing as
Playful as a pussycat
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild, wild
She's out to get you

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Recommended at the price
Insatiable in appetite
Wanna try?

You wanna try!

I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio

You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly

So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

You had your time
You had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio

All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah blah

Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years

Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things, on you we depend
So stick around, 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

You had your time
You had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio

All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga

It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
A kind of magic

One dream, one soul, one prize, one goal
One golden glance of what should be
It's a kind of magic

One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day
It's a kind of magic

The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
It's a kind of magic

The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity

Is this a kind of magic?
It's a kind of magic
There can be only one

This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done

This flame that burns inside of me
I'm hearing secret harmonies
It's a kind of magic

The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic

This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be, will soon be
Will soon be done

This is a kind of magic
There can be only one

This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done

Magic
It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
Magic, magic, magic, magic

Magic, it's magic
Alright
Yeah, yeah
Whoo
It's a kind of magic

I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day

Alright, hey hey

I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day of my life

You are the one for me
I am the man for you
You were made for me
You're my ecstasy
If I was given every opportunity
I'd kill for your love

So take a chance with me
Let me romance with you
I'm caught in a dream
And my dream's come true
It's so hard to believe
This is happening to me
An amazing feelin' comin' through

I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you, honey
Every single day of my life

I wanna love you
I love every little thing about you
I wanna love you, love you, love you

(Born) to love you
(Born) to love you
Yes, (born)
I was born to love you
(Born) to love you
(Born) to love you
Every single day, day, day, day, day, day
Day of my life

An amazing feelin' comin' through

I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day of my life

Yes, I was born to love you
Every single day of my life

Go, I love you babe
(Born to love you)
Yes, I was born to love you, hey
I wanna love you, love you, love you
I wanna love you, hey, yeah
It's magic (what's?)
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah
I wanna love you
It's magic
Love you, love you
Yeah, give it to me

Sometimes I get to feeling
I was back in the old days, long ago
When we were kids, when we were young
Thing seemed so perfect, you know
The days were endless, we were crazy, we were young
The Sun was always shining, we just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately I just don't know
The rest of my life's been just a show

Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now, but one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you

You can't turn back the clock, you can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame?
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use in sitting and thinking on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow

'Cause these are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now, but some things remain
When I look and I find no change

Those were the days of our lives, yeah
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now, but one thing's still true
When I look and I find
I still love you

I still love you

There's no time for us
There's no place for us
What is this thing that builds our dreams
Yet slips away from us

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?

There's no chance for us
It's all decided for us
This world has only one sweet moment
Set aside for us

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?

Who dares to love forever
Oh, when love must die?

But touch my tears with your lips
Touch my world with your fingertips
And we can have forever
And we can love forever
Forever is our today

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
Forever is our today

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
Forever is our today

Ooh, ooh, take it take it all away
Ooh, ooh, take my breath away
Ooh, ooh, you take my breath away

Look into my eyes and you'll see I'm the only one
You've captured my love stolen my heart
Changed my life
Every time you make a move you destroy my mind
And the way you touch
I lose control and shiver deep inside
You take my breath away

You can reduce me to tears with a single sigh
Ev'ry breath that you take
Any sound that you make is a whisper in my ear
I could give up all my life for just one kiss
I would surely die if you dismiss me from your love
You take my breath away

So, please, don't go
Don't leave me here all by myself
I get ever so lonely from time to time
I will find you anywhere you go
I'll be right behind you
Right until the ends of the earth
I'll get no sleep until I find you
To tell you that you just take my breath away

I will find you anywhere you go
Right until the ends of the earth
I'll get no sleep until I find you
To tell you when I've found you
I love you

Take my breath, take my breath away

Another red letter day
So the pound has dropped
And the children are creating
The other half run away
Taking all the cash
And leaving you with the lumber

Got a pain in the chest
Doctors on strike
What you need is a rest
It's not easy, love
But you've got friends you can trust

Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love
They give care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life
And all hope is lost
Hold out your hand
'Cause friends will be friends
Right till the end

Now it's a beautiful day
The postman delivered
A letter from your lover
Only a phone call away
You tried to track him down
But somebody stole his number

As a matter of fact
You're getting used to life
Without him in your way

It's so easy now
'Cause you got friends you can trust

Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life
And all hope is lost
Hold out your hand
'Cause friends will be friends
Right till the end

It's so easy now
'Cause you got friends you can trust

Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life
And all hope is lost
Hold out your hand
'Cause friends will be friends
Right till the end

Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life
And all hope is lost
Hold out your hand
'Cause right to the end
Friends will be friends

Friends will be friends
Friends will be friends
Friends will be friends
Right till the end

Delilah, Delilah
Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my, you're irresistible
You make me smile when I'm just about to cry
You bring me hope you make me laugh and I like it
You get away with murder so innocent
But when you throw a moody you're all claws and you bite
That's all right

Delilah, Delilah
Oh, my, oh my, oh my, you're unpredictable
You make me so very happy
When you cuddle up and go to sleep beside me
And then you make me slightly mad
When you pee all over my Chippendale suite

Delilah, Delilah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

You take over my house and home
You even try to answer my telephone
Delilah, you're the apple of my eye

Meow, meow, meow
Delilah, I love you, Delilah
Oh, you make me so very happy
You give me kisses and I go out of my mind, ooh
Meow, meow, meow
You're irresistible, I love you, Delilah
Delilah, I love you

Hah, hah
You make me very happy
Oh, yeah, I love your kisses
I love your kisses
I love your kisses
I love your kisses
I love your, your, your kisses
I love your kisses

Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You're taking all the sunshine away
Making out like you're the main line (I knew that)

'Cause you're a cool cat
Tapping on the toe with a new hat
Ooh, just cruising
Driving along with the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart, huh
Feeling the beat of my heart

Ooh, you're a cool cat
Coming on strong with all the chit chat
Ooh, you're alright
Hanging out and stealing all the limelight
Messing with the beat of my heart
Uh, messing with the beat of my heart, yeah

Ooh, you used to be a mean kid
Ooh, making such a deal of life
Ooh, you were wishing and hoping and waiting
To really hit the big time
But did it happen? Happen? No
You're speeding too fast, slow down
Slow down, you'd better slow down, slow down

You really know how to set the mood
And you really get inside the groove

Cool cat, tapping on the toe with a new hat
Ooh, just cruising
Driving along like the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart
Feeling the beat of my heart, yeah
Feeling the beat of my heart
Can you feel it?
Feeling the beat of my heart, eh-yeah
Feeling the beat of my heart
Ooh, ooh, feeling, feeling
Feeling ev'ry feeling

When the outside temperature rises
And the meaning is, oh, so clear
One thousand and one yellow daffodils
Begin to dance in front of you - oh, dear

Are they trying to tell you something?
You're missing that one final screw
You're simply not in the pink my dear
To be honest you haven't got a clue

I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened, happened
It finally happened, ooh, oh
It finally happened
I'm slightly mad
Oh, dear

I'm one card short of a full deck
I'm not quite the shilling
One wave short of a shipwreck
I'm not my usual top billing

I'm coming down with a fever
I'm really out to sea
This kettle is boiling over
I think I'm a banana tree
Oh, dear

I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened, happened
It finally happened, uh, huh
It finally happened
I'm slightly mad
Oh, dear

Ooh, ooh, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah
I'm knitting with only one needle
Unravelling fast it's true
I'm driving only three wheels these days
But, my dear, how about you?

I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened
It finally happened, oh, yes
It finally happened
I'm slightly mad
Just very slightly mad

And there you have it

Music is playing in the darkness
And a lantern goes swinging by
Shadows flickering my heart's jittering
Just you and I
Not tonight, come tomorrow
When everything's sunny and bright
(Sunny and bright)
No, no, no, come tomorrow, 'cause then
We'll be waiting for the moonlight

We'll go walking in the moonlight
Walking in the moonlight
Laughter ringing in the darkness
People drinking for days gone by
Time don't mean a thing
When you're by my side
Please stay a while

You know I never could foresee the future years
You know I never could see
Where life was leading me
But will we be together forever?
What will be my love?
Can't you see that I just don't know

No not tonight not tomorrow
Everything's gonna be alright (sunny and bright)
Wait and see if tomorrow we'll be
As happy as we're feeling tonight
We'll go walking in the moonlight (we'll be happy)
Walking in the moonlight

I can hear the music in the darkness
Floating softly to where we lie
No more questions now
Let's enjoy tonight
(Just you and I) just you and I
Just you and I

Can't you see that we've gotta be together
Be together just you and I just you and I
No more questions just you and I

And you got me like, oh
What you want from me? (What you want from me?)
And I tried to buy your pretty heart
But the price too high

Baby, you got me like, oh, mmm
You love when I fall apart (fall apart)
So you can put me together
And throw me against the wall

Baby, you got me like, I
Woo, I
Don't you stop loving me (loving me)
Don't quit loving me (loving me)
Just start loving me, ooh (loving me)

And, babe
I'm fist-fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something, babe?
And I'd run for miles just to get a taste

Must be love on the brain
That's got me feeling this way (feeling this way)
It beats me black and blue, but it fucks me so good
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain, yeah
And it keeps cursing my name (cursing my name)
No matter what I do, I'm no good without you
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain

Baby, keep loving me
Just love me, yeah
Just love me
All you need to do is love me, yeah

Got me like, oh-oh-oh-ow
I'm tired of being played like a violin
What do I gotta do to get in
Your motherfucking heart?

Baby, like, I
Woo, I
Don't you stop loving me (loving me)
Don't quit loving me (loving me)
Just start loving me, ooh (loving me)

And, babe
I'm fist-fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something, babe?
And I'd run for miles just to get a taste

Must be love on the brain
That's got me feeling this way (feeling this way)
It beats me black and blue, but it fucks me so good
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain, yeah
And it keeps cursing my name (cursing my name)
No matter what I do, I'm no good without you
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain

Uh, huh, uh, huh (yeah, Rihanna)
Uh, huh, uh, huh (good girl gone bad)
Uh, huh, uh, huh (take three, action)
Uh, huh, uh, huh (Hov)

No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank (eh, eh, eh)
Coming down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone, we Roc-A-Fella (eh, eh, eh, eh)
We fly higher than weather, in G5's or better
You know me
In anticipation for precipitation stack chips for the rainy day (eh, eh, eh)
Jay, Rain Man is back (eh, eh, eh)
With little Ms. Sunshine, Rihanna, where you at?

You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
May be in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share

Because
When the Sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella

Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart

Because
When the Sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella

Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

You can run into my arms
It's okay, don't be alarmed
Come into me
There's no distance in between our love
So go on and let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more, oh

Because
When the Sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella

Ooh, baby, it's rainin', rainin'
You can always come into me
Come into me
It's pourin' rain

Come here to me
Come into me


On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised

Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ooh, I love the way you lie

Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right

'Cause you feed me fables from your hand
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ooh, I love the way you lie

So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave
Til the walls are goin' up
In smoke with all our memories

This morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night
So I can push you off me

Try and touch me, so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room, and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs, 'cause we're that lucky

Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's countin'?
I may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counsellin'
This house is too huge, if you move out, I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
With you, I'm in my fuckin' mind, without you, I'm out it

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie


Lift me up
Hold me down
Keep me close
Safe and sound

Burning in a hopeless dream
Hold me when you go to sleep
Keep me in the warmth of your love when you depart
Keep me safe
Safe and sound

Lift me up
Hold me down
Keep me close
Safe and sound

Drowning in an endless sea
Take some time and stay with me
Keep me in the strength of your arms
Keep me safe
Safe and sound

Lift me up
Hold me down
Keep me safe
Safe and sound

Burning in a hopeless dream
Hold me when you go to sleep
Keep me safe
We need light

Hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me (hold me down)
Keep me safe
We need light

All along it was a fever
A cold sweat hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air and said: Show me something
He said: If you dare, come a little closer

Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now, you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay

It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now, you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay

Oh, the reason I hold on
Oh, 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay, stay
I want you to stay, oh


La la la la

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

(Mustard on the beat ho!)

I was good on my own, that's the way it was
That's the way it was
You was good on the low for a faded fuck
On some faded love
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?
Feeling jaded, huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I'll give it to you

But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it

You needed me
Oh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby, oh, you needed me

You been rollin' around, shit I'm rollin' up
Light and roll it up
Break it down, like a pound, shit was never us
Shit was never us
That's the real, on the real, are you serious?
How you feel, how you feel?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to ya
Had some fun on the run though, I give it to ya

But baby, don't get it twisted

Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch

Oh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby, oh, you needed me


I left a note on my bedpost
Saying not to repeat yesterday's mistakes
What I tend to do when it comes to you
I see only the good, selective memory

The way you make me feel, yeah, you got a hold on me
I never met someone so different
Oh, here we go
You're part of me now
You're part of me
So where you go I follow, follow, follow, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go

But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I can't remember to forget you

Ooh (hey)
I can't remember to forget you
Ooh

I go back again
Fall off the train
Land in his bed
Repeat yesterday's mistakes
What I'm tryna say is not to forget
You see only the good, selective memory

The way he makes me feel like
The way he makes me feel, I never seemed to act so stupid
Oh, there we go
He a part of me now
He a part of me
So where he goes I follow, follow, follow, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go

But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight (oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I can't remember to forget you

I rob and I kill to keep him with me
I'll do anything for that boy
I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight
I'll do anything for that boy

I rob and I kill to keep him with me
I'll do anything for that boy
I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight
I'll do anything for that boy

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go

But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight (oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I can't remember to forget you

But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight (oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I can't remember to forget you


I'm friends with a monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh, well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me

Been wanting my cake, and eat it too
And wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do is
Be the Bruce Lee of loose-leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool
When I blew steam (wooh!)

Hit the lottery, oh, wee
With what I gave up to get was bittersweet
With this like winning a huge meet
Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge
I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep

One sheep, two sheep
Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think
'Cause I'm

I'm friends with a monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's not fair

Well, that's not fair

No, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me
To seize the moment and don't squander it
'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjuring

Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
(Yeah, ponder it, do you want this?)
(No wonder you're losing your mind)
(The way it wanders)

Yo-lo-lo-lo-yee-whoo
I think you've been wandering off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love is killing me
And I can't conquer it
My OCD is conking me in the head
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
I'm just relaying what the voice
In my head's saying
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the

I'm friends with a monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's not fair

Well, that's not fair

Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I walk amongst you, a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed, and I'm coming straight at
Emcees, blood get spilled and I
Take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played at
Pumped up feeling and shit to say back
To the kids who played 'em
I ain't here to save the fucking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels
And then relates that's great

It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back
In the draft, turn nothing into something
Still can make that straw into gold chump
I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the

I'm friends with a monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

I'm friends with a monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's not fair

Well, that's not fair

Feels so good being bad
There's no way I'm turning back
Now the pain is for pleasure
'Cause nothing can measure

Love is great, love is fine
Out the box, out of line
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more

'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Na na na come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it

Love is great, love is fine
Out the box, out of line
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more

'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Na na na come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it

S, S, S and M, M, M
S, S, S and M, M, M

Oh I love the feeling you bring to me
Oh, you turn me on
It's exactly what I've been yearning for
Give it to me strong
And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say ah, ah, ah
I like it, like it

'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Na na na come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it

S, S, S and M, M, M

Sak Pasé!

I didn't mean to end his life
I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night
Can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight
Before I end up behind bars

What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry

'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun

Rum pu-pu-pum, rum pu-pu-pum
Rum pu-pu-pum
Man down
Rum pu-pu-pum, rum pu-pu-pum
Rum pu-pu-pum
Man down

Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why, oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station

It's a .22, I call her Peggy Sue
When she fits right down in my shoes
What do you expect me to do?
If you're playing me for a fool
I will lose my cool
And reach for my firearm

I didn't mean to lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm 'bout to leave town

'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun

Rum pu-pu-pum, rum pu-pu-pum
Rum pu-pu-pum
Man down
Rum pu-pu-pum, rum pu-pu-pum
Rum pu-pu-pum
Man down

Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why, oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station

Look I never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Oh, Gosh
What ever happened to me?
Ever happened to me?
Ever happened to me?
Why did I pull the trigger?
Pull the trigger, pull the trigger, boom!
And end a nigga, end a nigga's life so soon
When me pull the trigger
Pull the trigger, pull it on you
Somebody tell me what I'm gonna, what I'm gonna do

Rum pu-pu-pum, rum pu-pu-pum
Rum pu-pu-pum
Me say one man down
Oh, let me say
Rum pu-pu-pum, rum pu-pu-pum
Rum pu-pu-pum
When me went downtown

'Cause now I'm a criminal, criminal, criminal
Oh, Lord, oh, mercy, now I am a criminal
Man down
Tell the judge please give me minimal
Run out of town
None of them can see me now, see me now

Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh why, oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station

You have my hands to hold
So how come you won't hold me?
Your words are so damn cold
The winter can't affect me
You're man enough to say
What you think in my business
But you can't say you love me
Even in between the kisses

Tender, tender little kisses you give to me
Just like you give to her, tell me, how can you sleep?
Teardrops, little teardrops fallin' in disbelief
How can you lie to her while you lay with me?

Hey, hey, if you don't have an answer, just don't say
If you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
Hey, hey, I'm sure your lips can find the words to say
But if you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer

Your arms around me now
Felt like sunlight in the morning
It always comes around
But just not when I want it
So all you have to give
Is everything I needed
But it's so hard to live
Just wonderin' if you're givin'

Tender, tender little kisses you give to me
Just like you give to her, tell me, how can you sleep?
Teardrops, little teardrops fallin' in disbelief
How can you lie to her while you lay with me?

Hey, hey, if you don't have an answer, just don't say
If you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
Hey, hey, I'm sure your lips can find the words to say
But if you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer

You'd rather make up a lie than make up a fight
And then you get so upset when I ask you why, oh
I wonder what makes you feel
A part of you can't be real
You said you'd never hurt me
Then what do you think you did?

Hey, hey, if you don't have an answer, just don't say
If you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
Hey, hey, I'm sure your lips can find the words to say
But if you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer

Hey, hey, if you don't have an answer, just don't say
If you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
You don't have to answer

Love, love, love, love and affection
Love, love, l.o.v.eeeeee.e and affection

Boy lately, you've been stingy with your time
Got me wondering, I'm wondering if I'm on your mind
Boy I just wanna be in your possession
You say I'm the one you want so come express it

Don't slip, don't slip
Cause a nigga might push upon it
Don't really wanna lose this moment
Why window shop when you own this
I, I, I,don't put it down
I, I, I,don't fuck around
I, I, I, I want you now, I want you now
Oh, oh

I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love, love and affection
Love, love, l.o.v.eeeeeee and affection

Can you love me for poor
I'm searching for my soul
Who ever turned you cold
You need to let him know
I can work miracles
I'll work your physical
And when I love you close
You can feel my heart beating through my clothes

I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love, love and affection
Love, love, l.o.v.eeeeeee and affection


Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out

Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we fall out

Strip clubs and dollar bills
(I still got my money)
Patron shots, can I get a refill?
(I still got my money)
Strippers goin’ up and down the pole
(And I still got my money)
4 o'clock and we ain’t goin’ home
(Cuz' I still got my money)
Money make the world go round
(I still got my money)
Hands make your girl go down
(And I still got my money)
Lot more where that came from
(And I still got my money)
The look in your eyes, and know you want some
(And I still got my money)

Ooh, ooh
All I see is signs
All I see is dollar signs
Ooh, ooh
Money on my mind
Money, money on my mind
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it fall out from the sky

Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out

Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out

Valet cost a hundred bills
(And I still got my money)
Gold all up in my grill
(And I still got my money)
Who cares how you haters feel?
(And I still got my money)
Call Jay up and close a deal
(Cuz I still got my money)
My fragrance on, and they love my smell
(And I still got my money)
So who cares about what I spend?
(And I still got my money)
My pockets deep, and they never end
(And I still got my money)
I'm going dumb with all my friends
(I still got my money)

Ooh, ooh
All I see is signs
All I see is dollar signs
Ooh, ooh
Money on my mind
Money, money on my mind
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it fall out from the sky

Throw it up, throw it up

Watch it all fall out
Power it up, power it up

Take a breath, take it deep
Calm yourself, he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun, and count to three
I'm sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger, trigger)

Say a prayer to yourself
He says, close your eyes
Sometimes it helps
And then I get a scary thought
That he's here, means he's never lost

And you can see my heart beating
Now you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

As my life flashes before my eyes
I'm wondering will I ever see another sunrise?
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
But it's too late to think of the value of my life

And you can see my heart beating
Now you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving, no!
I know that I must pass this test
And you can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
That I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving, no!
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger, trigger)

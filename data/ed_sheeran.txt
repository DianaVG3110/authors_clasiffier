I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
Darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it
Darling, you look perfect tonight

I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a lover to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress
Looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this
Darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight

Loving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard
You know, it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So, you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
And you won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
And is the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So, you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
And you won't ever be alone

And if you hurt me
That's okay, baby
Only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

So you could fit me
Inside the necklace you got
When you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat, where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away
I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on 6th Street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And, darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking about how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So, honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking about how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

Then, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

So, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

Oh, baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are

It's just another night
And I'm staring at the Moon
I saw a shooting star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby
By the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you

You're on the other side
As the skyline splits in two
I'm miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars from America
I wonder, do you see them too?

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

I can hear your heart
On the radio beat
They're playing Chasing Cars and I thought of us
Back to the time
You were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love

So I took your hand
Back through lamp lit streets I knew
Everything led back to you
So, can you see the stars over Amsterdam?
You're the song my heart is beating to

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

And oh, I know
And oh, I know, oh
I can see the stars from America

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow

Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance
Now take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say: Boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Everyday discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I
I'm in love with your body
Everyday discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in, we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver: Make the radio play
And I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say: Boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Everyday discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I
I'm in love with your body
Everyday discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Everyday discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on (I'm in love with your body)
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on (I'm in love with your body)

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on (I'm in love with your body)
Everyday discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

(One, two, three, four)
Ooh, ooh

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the Sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise, before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights, endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes, stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now, I can't escape
Nothin' happens aftеr two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My bad habits lеad to you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My bad habits lead to you

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
Started under neon lights, and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights, endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes, stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now, I can't escape
Nothin' happens aftеr two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

We took the long way 'round
And burned till the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights, endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes, stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now, I can't escape
Nothin' happens aftеr two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My bad habits lead to you

I’m at a party I don’t wanna be at
And I don’t ever wear a suit and tie
Wondering if I can sneak out the back
Nobody's even looking me in my eyes
And then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say: Shall we dance? Hell, yeah!
Y’know I love you, did I ever tell you?
You make it better like that

Don’t think I fit in at this party
Everyone’s got so much to say, yeah
I always feel like I’m nobody
Who wants to fit in anyway?

'Cause I don’t care
When I’m with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you making me feel that maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I’m with my baby, yeah (ooh, ooh, ooh)

'Cause I don’t care
As long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you making me feel like I’m loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I’m with my baby, yeah (ooh, ooh, ooh)

We at a party we don’t wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can’t hear ourselves
Read your lips, I’d rather kiss ‘em right back
With all these people all around, I’m crippled with anxiety
But I’m told it's where I’m supposed to be
You know what?
It’s kind of crazy 'cause I really don’t mind
When you make it better like that

Don’t think we fit in at this party
Everyone’s got so much to say, oh, yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said: I’m sorry
But now I think that we should stay

'Cause I don’t care
When I’m with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you making me feel that maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I’m with my baby, yeah (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause I don’t care
As long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you making me feel like I’m loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I’m with my baby, yeah (ooh, ooh, ooh) (no)

I don’t like nobody but you
It’s like you’re the only one here
I don’t like nobody but you
Baby, I don’t care

I don’t like nobody but you
I hate everyone here
I don’t like nobody but you
Baby, yeah

'Cause I don’t care (don’t care)
When I’m with my baby, yeah (oh, yeah)
All the bad things disappear (disappear)
And you making me feel that maybe I am somebody (maybe I’m somebody)
I can deal with the bad nights (with the bad nights)
When I’m with my baby, yeah (ooh, ooh, ooh) (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

'Cause I don’t care
As long as you just hold me near (me near)
You can take me anywhere (anywhere, anywhere)
And you making me feel like I’m loved by somebody (loved by somebody, yeah)
I can deal with the bad nights
When I’m with my baby, yeah (ooh, ooh, ooh)

I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that taste like yours
Strawberries and somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all

Lipstick on my guitar, ooh
Fill up the engines, we can drive real far
Go dancing underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all, mm
Ooh, you got me feeling like

I wanna be that guy
I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile
I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire
I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singing like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're closer, give me thе shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And whеn they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back

And we'll say, ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're closer, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back

Into the car
On the back seat in the Moon lit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh, I can't get enough

You know you could tear me apart
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Ooh, I can't get enough
Ooh, you got me feeling like

I wanna be that guy
I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile
I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire
I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singing like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're closer, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back

And we'll say, ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're closer, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back

Baby, you are so hot you make me shiver
With the fire you got, this thing is started
I don't want it to stop, you know you make me shiver-er-er
Baby, you are so hot you make me shiver
With the fire you got, this thing is started
I don't want it to stop, you know you make me shiver
Yeah, you got me singing like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're closer, give me the shivers

And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back

(You good to go?)

All I knew
This morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before

And all I've seen
Since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said: Hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simplе name
Everything has changed

All I know is you hеld the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

And all my walls
Stood tall, painted blue
But I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you

And all I feel
In my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, makin' up for lost time
Takin' flight, making me feel like

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said: Hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed

All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

All I know is we said: Hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed

All I know is you held the door
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

All I know is we said: Hello
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed

All I know is a newfound grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Give me love like her
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you I'd let them go

And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

Give a little time to me
Or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek
To turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, oh give me love

My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, give me love

Give me love like never before
'Cause lately I've been craving more
And it's been a while, but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go

You know I'll fight my corner
And that tonight I'll call ya
After my blood is drowning in alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

Give a little time to me
Or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek
To turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, oh, give me love

Give a little time to me
Or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek
To turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, oh, give me love

My, my, my, my, oh, give me love
My, my, my, my, oh, give me love
My, my, my, my, oh, give me love
My, my, my, my, oh, give me love

M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover

M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (love me, love me, love me)

M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (give me love)
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (give me love)
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (give me love, love me)
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (give me love)

My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love

My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love

Oh, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Baby, I apologize for it

I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumping in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

You're a mystery
I have travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you, no one
What's your history? (What's your history?)
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, hmm

I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake, every day
Don't know how much I can take

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Sitting back, looking at
Every mess that I made

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
Let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you

Settle down with me
Cover me up, cuddle me in
Lay down with me, yeah
And hold me in your arms

And your heart’s against my chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I’m falling for your eyes, but they don’t know me yet
And with a feeling I’ll forget, I’m in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved, you wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love, we're falling in love

Settle down with me
And I’ll be your safety, you’ll be my lady
I was made to keep your body warm
But I’m cold as the wind blows
So hold me in your arms

My heart’s against your chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I’m falling for your eyes but they don’t know me yet
And with this feeling I’ll forget, I’m in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved, you wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love, we're falling in love

Yeah, I’ve been feeling everything
From hate to love, from love to lust, from lust to truth
I guess that’s how I know you
So hold you close to help you give it up

So kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved, you wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love, we're falling in love

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved, you wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love, we're falling in love

Walking down 29th and Park
I saw you in another's arms
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier

Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

'Cause baby, you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Sat on the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you're happier
Aren't you?

But ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you

But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

'Cause baby, you look happier, you do
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I'll be waiting here for you

White lips, pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say she's in the Class A team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
They scream
The worst things in life come free to us

‘Cos we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

And they say she's in the Class A team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
They scream
The worst things in life come free to us

‘Cos we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
But she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
And sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

An angel will die
Covered in white, closed eyed
And hoping for a better life
This time will fade out tonight
Straight down the line

And they say she's in the Class A team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
They scream
The worst things in life come free to us

And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in the pipe fly to the motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
For angels to die

Build the fire and gather 'round the trees
Fill the glass and maybe come and sing with me

So kiss me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know, but for now, merry Christmas

We'll dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We both know love, but this love we got is the best of all
I wish you could see it through my еyes and you would know
My God, you look beautiful right now, merry Christmas

Thе fire is raging on
And we'll all sing along to this song
Just having so much fun while we're here
Then we all spare a thought for the ones who have gone
Merry Christmas, everyone

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

So just keep kissin' me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
Yeah, there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know, for now, merry Christmas

We'll dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We both know love, but this love we got is the best of all
I wish you could see it through my eyes and you would know
My God, you look beautiful right now, merry Christmas

I feel it where it comes
Every year havin' us carry on
Filled up with so much love
All the family and friends are together
Where we all belong
Merry Christmas, everyone

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a merry Christmas
It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a merry Christmas
It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a merry Christmas
It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a merry Christmas time

I know it's a bad idea
But how can I help myself?
Been inside for most this year
And I thought a few drinks, they might help

It's been a while, my dear
Dealing with the cards life dealt
I'm still holding back these tears
While my friends are somewhere else

I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February
I stepped in the bar, it hit me so hard
Oh, how can it be this heavy?
Every song reminds me you're gone
And I feel the lump form in my throat
'Cause I'm here alone

Just dancing with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look I still see you
Time is moving so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancing with my
Ey-ey-ey-eyes, ey-ey-ey-eyes closed
Ey-ey-ey-eyes
So I'll keep dancing with my

Delusion is here again
And I think you'll come home soon
A word brings me right back in
Then it's only me that's in this room
I guess I could just pretend
The colours are more than blue
But I lost more than my friend
I can't help but missing you

I pictured this month a little bit different, no one is ever ready
And when it unfolds you get in a hole
Oh, how can it be this heavy?
Everything changes, nothing's the same
Except the truth is, now you're gone
And life just goes on

So I'm dancing with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look I still see you
Time is moving so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancing with my
Ey-ey-ey-eyes, ey-ey-ey-eyes closed
Ey-ey-ey-eyes

So I'll keep dancing with my
Ey-ey-ey-eyes, ey-ey-ey-eyes closed
Ey-ey-ey-eyes
Oh, I keep dancing with my

They're shutting the bar
They're cleaning the floor
And everyone is already home
But I'm on my own

Still dancing with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look I still see you
Time is moving so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancing with my
Ey-ey-ey-eyes, ey-ey-ey-eyes closed
Ey-ey-ey-eyes

Oh, I keep dancing with my
Ey-ey-ey-eyes, ey-ey-ey-eyes closed
Ey-ey-ey-eyes

Oh, I keep dancing with my

I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved

Took the Get Well Soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me: Don't you cry when you're down
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So I'll sing hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back He'll say: Hallelujah, you're home

I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

I hope that I see the world as you did, 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

So I'll sing hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back He'll say: Hallelujah, you're home

Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back He said: Hallelujah, you're home

Shock horror I'm down
Lost, you're not around
There's a lump in my chest that
Sends cold through my head and

My mind shuts sound out
I'm an auto pilot
And my tounge's gone silent
Just switch it off and lay it down
Lay it down
Next to me

I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine
Ooooohh
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
You said you said you said
That I miss you
And I miss you

These words mean nothing to me
I'm just sitting on a fence of how it used to be
These three words are aching
Come strip and suffocating

My mind is racing
With the picture I'm painting
My belly sick to its stomach
When I remember all the time
He was with you when I lay it down
You lay down
Next to me

I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine
Ooooohh
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
You said you said you said
That I miss you more than I let on
I kissed you, far too long
I'll let go, as soon as you do see I know
We're not through

I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine
Ooooohh
I don't when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
You said you said you said
That I miss you
That I miss you

Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could've been the medicine
And now you're lying in the bed again
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them

And my father told me: Son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
You're not the only one
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing

Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while, here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light, in life, in love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love

And things were all good yesterday
But then the devil took your breath away
And now we're left here in the pain
Black suit, black tie, standing in the rain
And now my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind, I should paint it with a pen
Six years old, I remember when

My father told me: Son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing

Darlin', hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while, here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light, in life, in love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love, love, love

To the love we love, we love, we love

And my father and all of my family rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my mother and all of my family rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
(And all of my brothers and my sisters, yeah)
And my father and all of my family rise from their seats to sing hallelujah

To the love we love, we love, we love
To the love we love, we love, we love
To the love we love, we love, we love

Will get up, up on the dancefloor tonight
I've got two left feet and a bottle of red wine
Making me feel like the beat and the bassline
Are in my blood, both hands up on her waistline
Get on up, baby, dance to the rhythm of the music
Don't care what the DJ chooses
Get lost in the rhythm with me
Please don't close until we wanna leave it

And you and I we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street
In Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona

Will get up, up on the dancefloor, move, it's a Saturday night
I fell in love with the sparkle in the moonlight
Reflected in your beautiful eyes
I guess that is destiny doing it right
And dance like they do in the Mediterranean
Spin you around me again and again, and
You're like something that God has sent me
I want you, baby, solamente

And you and I we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street
In Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Oh, Barcelona
So let's pretend we're dancing in the street
In Barcelona

Las Ramblas, I'll meet you
We'll dance around la Sagrada Familia (Barcelona)
Drinking Sangría
Mi niña, te amo mi cariño (Barcelona)
Mamacita, rica
Si tú, te adoro señorita (Barcelona)
Nosotros, viva la vida
Come on, let's be free in Barcelona

Las Ramblas, I'll meet you
Come on and dance with me in Barcelona
Drinking Sangría
I just want to be in Barcelona
Mamacita, rica
Feel that summer breeze in Barcelona
Nosotros, viva la vida
Siempre vida, Barcelona

Bibia be ye ye

I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me
From each scar upon my knuckle
And each graze upon my knee
And all I know is I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand new day

Someone told me: Always say what's on your mind
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye
Bibia be ye ye

I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts, from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day

Someone told me: Always say what's on your mind
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye

Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)

Someone told me: Always say what's on your mind
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye
Bibia be ye ye

Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye) (bibia be ye ye, ye ye ye ye)
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Bibia be ye ye
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye

I've been spinning out of time
Couple women by my side
I got sinning on my mind, sipping on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded, how'd I get so faded

Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Oh, colour crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well, tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in

I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord, forgive for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon a broken hearted lover

Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Oh, colour crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well, tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in

All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line

All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line

All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line

(All the voices in my mind)
Tell me when it kicks in
(Calling out across the line)
And I saw scars upon her
(All the voices in my mind)
Tell me when it kicks in
(Calling out across the line)
Broken hearted

(All the voices in my mind)
Tell me when it kicks in
(Calling out across the line)
And I saw scars upon her
(All the voices in my mind)
Tell me when it kicks in
(Calling out across the line)
Broken hearted

(All the voices in my mind)
Tell me when it kicks in
(Calling out across the line)
And I saw scars upon her
(All the voices in my mind)
Tell me when it kicks in
(Calling out across the line)
Broken hearted

(All the voices in my mind)
Tell me when it kicks in
(Calling out across the line)
And I saw scars upon her
(All the voices in my mind)
Tell me when it kicks in
(Calling out across the line)
Broken hearted

So tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken hearted

Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken hearted

When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as I rolled down
I was younger then
Take me back to when

I found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know, I've grown
I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old smoking hand rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon I did it right
But I was younger then
Take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed

One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way
I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

(Ah, la, la, la, la)
(Ah, la, la, la, la)
(Ah, la, la, la, la)

I met this girl late last year
She said: Don't you worry if I disappear
I told her: I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend, thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time, for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right

I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me: I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM
Baby, if you wanted me, then should have just said, she's singing
Ah, la, la, la, la

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe (ah, la, la, la, la)
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take, aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe (ah, la, la, la, la)

And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track, like a feature
And never wants to sleep, but guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day

And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe, we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing
(Ah, la, la, la, la)

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe (ah, la, la, la, la)
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take, aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe (ah, la, la, la, la)

(Knock, knock, knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course

It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing
(Ah, la, la, la, la)

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe (ah, la, la, la, la)
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take, aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe (ah, la, la, la, la)

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe (ah, la, la, la, la)
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take, aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe (ah, la, la, la, la)

I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth, I hate what didn’t kill me
It never made me stronger at all

Love will scar your make up
Lips sticks to me, so now I maybe lean back there
I’m sat here, wishing I was sober
I know I’ll never hold you like I used to

But a house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold, I’ll be freezing
Can’t rely on my heart to beat in
‘Cos you take parts of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like: When you leaving me?

Should I?
Should I?
Maybe I’ll get drunk again
I’ll be drunk again
I’ll be drunk again
To feel a little love

I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a coke can
And I got no plans for the weekend, so should we speak then?
Keep it between friends
Though I know you’ll never love me like you used to

There may be other people like us
Who see the flicker of a Clipper when they light up
Flames just create us, but burns don’t heal like before
And you don’t hold me anymore

On cold days cold plays out like the band’s name
I know I can’t heal things with a handshake
You know I can change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make

Should I?
Should I?
Maybe I’ll get drunk again
I’ll be drunk again
I’ll be drunk again
To feel a little love

All by myself, I’m here again
All by myself, you know I’ll never change
All by myself
All by myself

I’m just drunk again
I’ll be drunk again
I’ll be drunk again
To feel a little love

I was born inside a small town, and I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now, the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon, they kept me on the grind

So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy, when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride

You know that I've got whisky with white lines, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become

I guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or an uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see

I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said, give me one more

I am another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your loving arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell
Relationships, and hearts you fix, they break as well

And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, and this should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become

Conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve, telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans

Wembley Stadium crowd's, two hundred and forty thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damien's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now
Somehow

I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said, give me one more

I am another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your loving arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
But my heart will stay the same

Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
My pain eraser

And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said: Baby, I just want to dance

I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me: What does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said: Baby, I just want to dance
With my pretty little Galway girl
You're my pretty little Galway girl

You know, she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to céilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said: Baby, I just want to dance
My pretty little Galway girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl

And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said: Baby, I just want to dance
My pretty little Galway girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl

Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I heard he's on a new diet and watches what he eats

He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me

But still, I'm just keeping it real
Still looking at your Instagram and I'll be creeping a little
I'll be trying not to double tap, from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when you used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't superman
Just a young boy trying to be loved
So let me give it to you

I don't wanna know about your new man, 'cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Your new man rents a house in the burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year he goes to Malaga, with all the fellas
Drinks beer but has a six-pack, I'm kind of jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors in winter at night-time
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gun sign
Says: Chune, bwoydem light up the room
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl that sat beside the water reading
Eating a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheating
Now you're eating kale, hitting the gym, keeping up with Kylie & Kim
In the back of the club kissing a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought that I would tell you 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl trying to be loved
So let me give it to you

I don't wanna know about your new man, 'cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Baby, I'm not trying to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please, remember you're still free to make the choice and leave
And don't call me up, you need to show me

I don't wanna know about your new man, 'cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Positive t-that he don't wanna know about
P-P-Positive that he don't wa-wanna know about
I-I-I don't wanna know abo-bo-bo-bo-bout your new man

Tell me that you'll turn down the man
Who asks for your hand
'Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams
And just stay with me?

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one

Take my hand and my heart and soul
And I will only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if we see this through
And you could stay within these walls and bleed
Or just stay with me, oh, Lord

Now all my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one

Stumbling half drunk
Getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong

And all my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one

I've known it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine
Disappearing all night
I don't wanna know where he's been lying
I know what I wanna do
I wanna runaway, runaway with you
Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning, go

How long you leaving?
Well, dad just don't expect me back this evening
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day
Almost out of the roadway
But I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own

I've never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone in the kitchen light
I tell you it's about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
And this is what I'm gonna do
Gonna runaway, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes, and when it's morning, go

How long you leaving?
Well, dad just don't expect me back this evening
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day
Almost out of the roadway
But I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own

Back pack, and a flat cap, turned to the back
'Cause I packed my clothes up
My dad wasn't down with that plan to attack
Intends to show love
I don't wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
I could be persuaded to hold up
And mama was the same
None of us are saints
I guess that God knows that
I don't wanna runaway
And one of these days I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoelaces, and hold that
Things change, but for now I leave town with a backpack on my shoulder

I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own

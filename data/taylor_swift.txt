We could leave the Christmas lights up till January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close, forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my
Lover

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close, forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Lover

Ladies and gentlemen, will you, please, stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close, forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my
Lover

There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face

All I can say is it was
Enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered: Have we met?
'Cross the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks like
Passing notes in secrecy

And it was
Enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was
Enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder till I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door, I'd
Open up and you would say

Hey, it was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was
Enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew

This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that

This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you (oh)

This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew

This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past thinkin' your future was me

And you were tossing me the car keys
Fuck The Patriarchy keychain on the ground
We were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down: Any time now
He's gonna say it's love
You never called it what it was

'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing, it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame
And you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well

And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well

And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

They say all's well that ends well
But I'm in a new hell every time
You double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age
Maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die

The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel
Whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened: You
That's what happened: You

You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night
Willin' you to come
And he said: It's supposed to be fun
Turning 21

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight

And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us (just between us)m I remember it all too well (wind in my hair)
(I was there, I was there)
(Down the stairs, I was there, I was there)
(Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there)
(It was rare, you remember it all too well)

(Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there)
(Down the stairs, I was there, I was there)
(Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there)
(It was rare, you remember it all too well)

(Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there)
(Down the stairs, I was there, I was there)
(Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there)
(It was rare, you remember it)

(Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there)
(Down the stairs, I was there, I was there)
(Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there)

My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a twenty year dark night
And now, I see daylight
I only see daylight

Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke

Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a twenty year dark night
(Now, I'm wide awake)
And now, I see daylight (daylight), I only see daylight (daylight)

I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

And I can still see it all (in my mind)
All of you, all of me (intertwined)
I once believed love would be (black and white)
But it's golden (golden)
And I can still see it all (in my head)
Back and forth from New York (sneaking in your bed)
I once believed love would be (burning red)
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a twenty year dark night
(Now, I'm wide awake)
And now, I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (ah)

I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (aah)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (and I can still see it all)
(Back and forth from New York)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(I once believed love would be burning red)

Like daylight
It's golden
Like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go

I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things that I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
Not the things that haunt me in the middle of the night, I
I just think that
You are what you love

I sit and watch you reading with your head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser and I

I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listеn
I polish plates until they gleam and glistеn
You're so much older and wiser and I

I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

While you were out building other worlds, where was I?
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I

Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you then lose it
Believe me, I could do it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

I sit and watch you

Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
A long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise

Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)

And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat

I say: I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl
(Some other girl)

He says: What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinking about you, and I
I said: I've been there too, a few times

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (a tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style (we never go, we never go)
We never go out of style

Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah, just take me home
Oh, oh, oh
(Out of style)

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time (and when we go)
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh, my God, look at that face!
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
Oh, my God, who is she?
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

You went to a party
I heard from everybody
You part the crowd like the red sea
Don't even get me started
Did you get anxious, though
On the way home?
I guess I'll never ever know
Now that we don't talk

You grew your hair long
You got new icons
And from the outside
It looks like you're trying lives on
I miss the old ways
You didn't have to change
But I guess I don't have a say
Now that we don't talk

I call my mom, she said that it was for the best
Remind myself the morе I gave, you'd want me less
I cannot bе your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost
And what it cost, now that we don't talk

What do you tell your friends we
Shared dinners, long weekends with?
Truth is, I can't pretend it's
Platonic, it's just ended, so

I call my mom, she said to get it off my chest (off my chest)
Remind myself the way you faded till I left (until I left)
I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost (of what I lost)
And what it cost, now that we don't talk

I don't have to pretend I like acid rock
Or that I'd like to be on a mega yacht
With important men who think important thoughts
Guess maybe I am better off now that we don't talk
And the only way back to my dignity
Was to turn into a shrouded mystery
Just like I had been when you were chasing me
Guess this is how it has to be now that we don't talk

Vintage tee, brand-new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (oh, yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (oh, yeah, you're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (oh, yeah, you're right, I want it)
You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (oh, yeah, you're right, I want it)

So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)
Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer, just to seal my fate (oh)
And I scream for whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?
He looks up, grinning like a devil

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)
Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer, just to seal my fate (oh)
And I scream for whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, hm, hm
That's what people say, hm, hm

I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, hm, hm
That's what people say, hm, hm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music
In my mind, saying it's gonna be alright

'Cause the players gonna play (play, play, play, play)
And the haters gonna hate (hate, hate, hate, hate)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake (shake, shake, shake, shake)
I shake it off, I shake it off

Heartbreakers gonna break (break, break, break, break)
And the fakers gonna fake (fake, fake, fake, fake)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake (shake, shake, shake, shake)
I shake it off, I shake it off

I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, hm, hm
That's what they don't see, hm, hm

I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, hm, hm
That's what they don't know, hm, hm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music
In my mind, saying it's gonna be alright

'Cause the players gonna play (play, play, play, play)
And the haters gonna hate (hate, hate, hate, hate)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake (shake, shake, shake, shake)
I shake it off, I shake it off

Heartbreakers gonna break (break, break, break, break)
And the fakers gonna fake (fake, fake, fake, fake)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake (shake, shake, shake, shake)
I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Hey, hey, hey!
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars
And the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You could've been getting down to this sick beat

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
And she's like: Oh my God
But I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby?
We can shake, shake, shake
Yeah, oh!

'Cause the players gonna play (play, play, play, play)
And the haters gonna hate (hate, hate, hate, hate) (haters gonna hate)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake (shake, shake, shake, shake)
I shake it off, I shake it off

Heartbreakers gonna break (break, break, break, break)
And the fakers gonna fake (fake, fake, fake, fake)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake (shake, shake, shake, shake)
I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (you got to)
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Once upon a time, the planets and the fates
And all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room
At the same time

And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn't lose

What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me, nothing was gonna stop me?
I laid the groundwork and then, just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line

What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all by design
'Cause I'm a mastermind

You see, all the wisest women had to do it this way
'Cause we were born to be the pawn in every lover's game

If you fail to plan, you plan to fail
Strategy sets the scene for the tale
I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails
And the liquor in our cocktails

What if I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me, I knew I wanted your body?
I laid the groundwork and then, just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line

What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all my design
'Cause I'm a mastermind

No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since
To make them love me and make it seem effortless
This the first time I felt the need to confess
And I swear, I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian
'Cause I care

So I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me, nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork and then, saw a wide smirk
On your face, you knew the entire time

You knew that I'm a mastermind
And now you're mine
Yeah, all you did was smile
'Cause I'm a mastermind

You're talkin’ shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you’re relevant
You’re terrified to look down
‘Cause if you dare, you’ll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It’s coming back around

And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn’t know what I mean

‘Cause karma is my boyfriend, karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Spidеr-boy, king of thieves
Weavе your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once, trick me twice
Don’t you know that cash ain’t the only price?
It’s coming back around

And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn’t know what I mean

‘Cause karma is my boyfriend, karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here (I'm still here)

‘Cause karma is the thunder, rattling your ground
Karma’s on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karma’s gonna track you down
Step by step, from town to town
Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Comin’ straight home to me

‘Cause karma is my boyfriend, karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Karma is my boyfriend, karma is a god
Karma’s a relaxing thought

This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh, damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do

('Cause I like you)
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
(Yeah, I want you)
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
(Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate

Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it?
Isn't it delicate?

Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share

('Cause I like you)
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
(Yeah, I want you)
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
(Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate

Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it?
Isn't it delicate?

Sometimes, I wonder: When you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes, when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time

('Cause I like you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
(Delicate)
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
(Delicate)

('Cause I like you)
Is it cool that I said all that? (Isn't it?)
Is it chill that you're in my head? (Isn't it, isn't it?)
'Cause I know that it's delicate
(Isn't it delicate?)
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that? (Isn't it?)
Is it too soon to do this yet? (Isn't it, isn't it?)
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it delicate?

(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

Once the flight had flown (uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (uh-huh)
I slept all alone (uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
Come here, I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out
Baby, was it over then?
And is it over now?

(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

Whеn you lost control (uh-huh)
Red blood, white snow (uh-huh)
Blue dress on a boat (uh-huh)
Your new girl is my clone

And did you think I didn't see you? There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency to keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs and my whispered sighs
Oh, lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come running
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (oh no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (oh)
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby

Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
Come here, I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out
Baby, was it over then?
And is it over now?

Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh

And did you think I didn't see you? There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency to keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs and my whispered sighs
Oh, lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come running (running)
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

Flashin' lights, oh, lord (oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (oh, lord)
I've been wanting (oh, lord)
But no

I remember when we broke up, the first time
Saying: This is it, I’ve had enough! ‘Cause, like
We hadn’t seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (what?)

Then you come around again and say: Baby
I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say: I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever
Getting back together
We are never, ever, ever
Getting back together
You go talk to your friends
Talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together

Like, ever!

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights, and me
Falling for it, screaming that I'm right, and you
Would hide away and find your peace of mind with some
Indie record that’s much cooler than mine

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever
Getting back together
We are never, ever, ever
Getting back together
You go talk to your friends
Talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together

Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah, oh, oh, oh

I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say: Never say never

Ugh, so he calls me up and he’s like: I still love you
And I'm like, I'm just
Yeah, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together
Like, ever!
No

We are never, ever, ever
Getting back together
We are never, ever, ever
Getting back together
You go talk to your friends
Talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together

(We) getting back together (ooh, ooh, ooh)
(We) getting back together (ooh, ooh, ooh)
You go talk to your friends
Talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together

Flamingo pink, Sunrise boulevard
Clink, clink, being this young is art
Aquamarine, moonlit swimming pool
What if all I need is you?

Got love-struck, went straight to my head
Got lovesick all over my bed
Love to think you'll never forget
Handprints in wet cement
Adorned with smoke on my clothes
Lovelorn and nobody knows
Love thorns all over this rose
I'll pay the price, you won't

But if I'm all dressed up
They might as well be lookin' at us
And if they call me a slut
You know it might be worth it for once
And if I'm gonna be drunk
Might as well be drunk in love

Send the code, he's waitin' there
The sticks and stones they throw froze mid-air
Everyone wants him, that was my crime
The wrong place at the right time
And I break down, then he's pullin' me in
In a world of boys, he's a gentleman

Got love-struck, went straight to my head (straight to my head)
Got lovesick all over my bed (over my bed)
Love to think you'll never forget
We'll pay the price, I guess

But if I'm all dressed up (if I'm all dressed up)
They might as well be lookin' at us (lookin' at us)
And if they call me a slut (if they call me a slut)
You know it might be worth it for once (worth it for once)
And if I'm gonna be drunk
I might as well be drunk in love

Half asleep, takin' your time
In the tangerine, neon light, this is luxury
You're not sayin' you're in love with me
But you're going to
Half awake, takin' your chances
It's a big mistake, I said, it might blow up in your pretty face
I'm not saying: Do it anyway (do it any)
But you're going to

(Up)
And if they call me a (slut)
You know it might be worth it for once
And if I'm gonna be (drunk)
Might as well be drunk in love

My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown, but it's alright

All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doing better than I ever was

'Cause my baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm

All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him

And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right

I'm laughing with my lover, making forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparking up my darkest night

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
Chain 'round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I

I recall late November
Holding my breath, slowly, I said
You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?
Yes (would you run away?)

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

(Call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)

(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
Call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying yes instead of no
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know, the greatest films of all time were never made

I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

I had this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know, the greatest loves of all time are over now

I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?

We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walking in the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what ya doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry

I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me

It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Ah, ah, ah, ah

It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical
Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh, oh

I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you

You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're

Twenty-two, ooh, ooh
Twenty-two, ooh, ooh, ooh

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids
Ah, ah, ah, ah (who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ew)

It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping

Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical
Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh, oh

I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you

You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're

Twenty-two, ooh, ooh
Twenty-two, ooh, ooh, ooh
(I don't know about you)
Twenty-two, ooh, ooh
Twenty-two, ooh, ooh, ooh

(It feels like one of those nights)
We ditch the whole scene
(It feels like one of those nights)
We won't be sleeping
(It feels like one of those nights)
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

Ooh, ooh
Eh, eh, eh, yeah

I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you

You don't know about me (you don't know about me)
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're (dance like we're twenty-two)

Twenty-two, ooh, ooh
Twenty-two, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Dancing like)
Twenty-two, ooh, ooh (yeah, yeah, eh, yeah, yeah, eh)
Twenty-two, ooh, ooh, ooh

(It feels like one of those nights)
We ditch the whole scene
(It feels like one of those nights)
We won't be sleeping
(It feels like one of those nights)
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the Sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism
Lightly disguised as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(Tale as old as time)

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all of its meaning
(For the last time)

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the Sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers around and reads it and someone screams out
She's laughing up at us from hell

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi, everybody agrees, everybody agrees

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees (everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the Sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero

Salt air and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of: Are you sure?
Never have I ever before

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Your back beneath the Sun
Wishing I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinking I had you

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Back when we were still changing for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say: Meet me behind the mall
So much for summer love and saying us
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, oh

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

'Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember?

Remember when I pulled up and said: Get in the car
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
Meet me behind the mall

(Remember when I pulled up and said: Get in the car)
(And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?)
(Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
(Meet me behind the mall)

Remember when I pulled up and said: Get in the car
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (for the hope of it all)
For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know, it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shining? Now, it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me
Where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound, like you're laughing right at me

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know, it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kinda wounds, they last, and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're coming my way, just don't

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know, it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know, it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em (think we can solve 'em)
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood ('cause now we got bad blood)
You know, it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done (look what you've done)
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey (ooh, woah)
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (oh, yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (oh, yeah, you're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (oh, yeah, you're right, I want it)
You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (oh, yeah, you're right, I want it)

So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)
Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer, just to seal my fate (oh)
And I scream for whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?
He looks up, grinning like a devil

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)
Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer, just to seal my fate (oh)
And I scream for whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holding him for ransom, some
Some boys are trying too hard, he don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby, mmm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist and
We'll move to an island and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

I, I, I see how this is gon' go (go)
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low (low)
No one has to know (no one has to know)

In the middle of the night, in my dreams (yeah)
You should see the things we do (we do), baby, mmm (mmm)
In the middle of the night (the night), in my dreams (my dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

Oh
Are you ready for it?

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin (now)
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night (night), in my dreams (my dreams)
You should see the things we do (we do), baby (baby), mmm ('eah)
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (my dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time (yeah)
In the middle of the night

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?

Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me?
Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself?
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him

You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me?
Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself?
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you
When she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said: James, get in, let's drive
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long

Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me?
Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you

You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

Dom Perignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems

Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
This dorm was once a madhouse
I made a joke: Well, it's made for me
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
Till someone's on their knees and asks you
She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head, they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

I've been breaking hearts a long time
And toying with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shaking, pacing, I just need you

For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say: She's gone too far this time

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby
Echoes of your name inside my mind
Halo, hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy

And, baby, for you, I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away
I'd beg you on my knees to stay

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

I get so high (oh)
Every time you're, every time you're loving me
You're loving me
Trip of my life (oh)
Every time you're, every time you're touching me
You're touching me
Every time you're, every time you're loving me

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life
(Using for the rest of my life, oh)

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right (doing it right)
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life (oh)

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right (doing, doing it right)
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

I get so high (oh)
Every time you're, every time you're loving me
You're loving me
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When we were younger, down in the park
Honey, making a lark of the misery

You got shiny friends since you left town
A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
And I got nothing but well wishes for ya

Oh, this place is the same as it ever was
Oh, but you won't like it that way

It's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of bеing known for who you know
You know, that you'll always know me, Dorothea (uh, uh)
Dorothea (ah, ah)

Oh, you'rе a queen sellin' dreams, sellin' make up in magazines
Oh, from you I'd buy anything

Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When it was calmer, skipping the prom just to piss off your mom
And her pageant schemes
And damn, Dorothea, they all wanna be ya
But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers?
Well

Oh, I guess I'll never know
Oh, and you'll go on with the show

But it's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of being known for who you know
You know, you'll always know me, Dorothea (uh, uh)
Dorothea (ah, ah)

Ooh, ooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Dorothea (ah, ah, ah)
Ah, ah
